        "This assignment was an excellent opportunity to apply advanced Python programming skills to a real-world scenario—designing an inventory management and flight booking system. It reinforced file handling, exception management, and object-oriented programming (OOP) while emphasizing the importance of handling edge cases such as invalid inputs, overbooking, and corrupted CSV files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges Faced\n",
        "Handling Edge Cases: Ensuring that the system accounts for missing or incorrect data, preventing overbooking, and managing canceled flights required careful exception handling.\n",
        "Data Persistence with CSV: Maintaining data integrity while reading and writing to CSV files was a challenge, particularly handling large datasets and avoiding data corruption.\n",
        "Balancing Simplicity & Features: Designing an intuitive interface while keeping the system scalable and extensible required thoughtful structuring of functions and logic.\n",
        "Aspects I Enjoyed\n",
        "Implementing a real-world system that could be extended for commercial use.\n",
        "Designing automation features, such as initializing flight records and ensuring data consistency across operations.\n",
        "Writing error-handling logic to make the system more robust and user-friendly.\n",
        "Opinion on Time Given\n",
        "The time provided for the assignment was reasonable, but the complexity of ensuring robust error handling, efficient CSV operations, and implementing advanced features (e.g., performance reports) made it challenging within a short timeframe. A bit more time would allow for better optimization and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggestions for Improvement\n",
        "More Structured Milestones: Breaking the assignment into smaller tasks with progressive deadlines could help in managing workload efficiently.\n",
        "Database Integration: While CSV storage is useful, introducing SQL-based data storage could enhance scalability and persistence.\n",
        "GUI Integration: A graphical user interface (GUI) could be an interesting extension, making the system more user-friendly."
