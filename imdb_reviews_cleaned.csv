"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",past pm finished watching francis ford coppola godfather probably go bed late tomorrow wake bit early early enough postpone writing line seen three time opportunity sharing thought refreshed insight much good offer sit bear film work well take place underworld embedded even observe coppola put u straight smackdab center admittedly society made criminal criminal also reason welcoming surrounded inhabitantscoldblooded murderer men see crime like job masquerading honorable men mean men outside would witness horrifying disturbing manifestation wellthought action go even deeper revolves around corleone family led vito corleone marlon brando honest men sitting right edge people like fully embrace world easy avoids conflict absolutely necessary man defined moral principle scene beginning daughter wedding day one associate luca brasi lenny montana practice speech going give meet scene two funny almost adorable could help sympathize realize feeling warmth two mobster even mention lenny montana actual mob hitman actually nervous said line watched realized incredibly complex ruthless society power corrupt anyone come contact best example corleones youngest son michael al pacino return home sister wedding war hero dressed part longtime girlfriend kay adam diane keaton first avoids underworld necessity firsthand exposure sheer devilish appealing nature draw get film change shocking every outsider ever got close tainted one way another survive drawn well viewer inside coppola expose family u fully bold personal approach witness every discussion every methodically calculated choice crime done simply nature business put chair alongside easily relate u good guy rival family bad guy greatest feat film managed pull offset apart good guy bad guy world filled bad guy film unmatched subtlety movie sustains good film done precision attention completeness many layer probably missed maybe never notice felt director francis ford coppola partner crime poor choice word sorry mario puzo nothing short timeless piece reference cinema whose influence based reinventing wheel rather perfecting absolute maximum masterpiece remembered historical contribution citizen kane brought biggest stepup art form thing gone wind space odyssey godfather one film remembered simply good cannot possibly imagine greater achievement
"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.",masterclass film making godfather contender best film time id argue case ultimate gangster movie panic thought film almost three hour long neednt wont even notice time fly production value incredible look sublime whole way well produced roughly fifty year old put many new film shame brandon pacino castellano incredible performance could add whole lot youre considering buying hard copy would recommend blu ray sharper dvd difference film huge influence year still forever one greatest
"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",acting simply amazing else could say could appealing peopleeven today watching actor like al pacino marlon brando james caan diane keaton talia shire robert duvall like heaven someone fan movie movie brando able bring back limelight performance godfather alone iconic character recreated much film almost already become cliché performance though cliché performance subtle breathtaking genuine realistic probably definitely genuine marlon brando al pacino perfect film well way start career character depth displayed perfectly able display innerbattles mind well battle family friend enemy character psychological character study anything else robert duvall glue movie added different perspective everything italian yet respect mafia character man high authority within corleone family listened insightful simply perfect giving film great balance throughout rest cast icing cake writing phenomenal breathtaking mentioned movie quoted even quote though make writing perfect symbolism meaning went every scene countless symbol message line memorable yet realistic movie could get
"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",godfather quite simply masterful piece filmmaking epic truest sense word far finest gangster film ever shot made finesse style spare director elicits pitchperfect performance talented cast moviemaking yes long film yes section quite slow nevertheless none film less riveting story fatherson takeover one new york major italian mafia family fairly straight forward yet francis ford coppola turn something else much meditation human condition perhaps certainly film explores darker side humanity jealousy betrayal anger revenge key theme film inevitably punctuated moment graphic shocking violence im glad coppola chooses shy away said violence make gritty realistic happen marlon brando take showrunner role patriarch who past prime easy spot real star piece al pacino burn screen sheer ferocity robert duvall easy miss quieter part watch james caan whose volatile sonny one film engaging character altogether splendid unforgettable piece filmmaking inevitably spawned sequel whole gamut similar gangster fare godfather tower head shoulder
"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",today havent bothered review godfather everyone pretty much know one greatest film ever made imdbs top best picture oscar nearly review imdb whats one review well completing review nut guess time got around reviewing film reviewed long time ago goesthe film perfect dope wouldnt watch unfortunately imdb requires say meet line minimum review ill point need like gangster film enjoy film yes violent nasty spotsbut also brilliantly written produced start finish deserves accolade received advice instead watching godfather godfather part ii see combined version created televisionwith additional scene made rich experience
"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.",im year old first time ive watched godfather feel like ive missed something like definitely enjoyed film dragged way longer shouldve definitely pointless scene understand way ahead time im obviously watching year late reason believe didnt enjoy much rest read rest review old film actually really enjoyed dont blame youth ill definitely watch second one aswell point im sure ill really like one ive seen film ive given way better marlon oscar best leading role think shouldve best supporting role al pacino shouldve put oscar marlon wasnt film nearly much thought hed definitely wasnt bad film fact good film thats good film

"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.

The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.

But i never get into it.

The plot is ok but i wanted more.

I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.

They just ""looked"" and there was silence.

I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".

I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.

The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.

Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.

For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.

I still need to watch Part 2 and 3.

It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story? Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.

"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away.

"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them!

"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents.

This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream.

"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.

I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.

The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.",godfather one wellknown film time popularity made legend ultimate mafia film film crop everyday conversation memorable scene horse severed head dead mafia man tomato garden chasing little boy around one film consider best film ever made people thought scene story done brilliantly film difficult follow ive seen much better film godfather despite good scene photography would classify average film good probably could better failed really inspire film
"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.

"The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.

Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.

The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.

With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.

This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10.",godfather strong contender best film ever made id argue ultimate gangster movie dont worry nearly threehour runtime wont even notice time passing fly production value astounding visual appeal remains impressive throughout around fifty year old outshines many modern film performance brando pacino castellano among others acting phenomenal youre considering hard copy recommend bluray version sharper dvd difference noticeable film significant influence year always one greatest

"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.

For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.",im ready downvoted oblivion intellectually appreciate style influence popularity film attested lasting reputation universally positive review along classic like battleship potemkin metropolis massive impact lauded masterpiece yet like film think value piece film history emotional viewing experience put bluntly see masterpiece time dont feel way watch sure ill give plenty credit acting atmosphere cinematographic technique add soft dreamlike quality everything portrayal gangster seemed far know grounded humanistic caricatured however definitely part drag didnt feel engaging watched expectation idea status id probably think well made film older era nothing earthshattering
"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.

Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.

Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.

Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.

So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.

"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time.

"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.",godfather arguably overrated movie ever made fair technical feast impressive period design music memorable nothing else pacino dull keaton forgettable duvall go motion script lack punch probably goodfellas one movie tell rise fall story godfather three movie far enjoyable vivid way
"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.

The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.

Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.

But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.

To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.

But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.

Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).

Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.",marlon brando vito corleone head perhaps powerful new yorkarea mafia family wellrespected film directorwriter francis ford coppola film begin vito receiving business guest office home daughter connies talia shire wedding reception taking place epic plot take place many year telling story vito familyincluding michael al pacino santino james caan tom hagen robert duvall associate interaction mob syndicate godfather commonly considered one greatest film time even though ive given wouldnt put kind exalted emphasis ive given literally thousand film year godfather barely made think number flaw coppola also knack transcending problem brilliant move another rate definitely mustsee viewingeven highly regardedif youve experienced film yet think good idea attain cultural literacy film popularly loved godfather become necessary element achieving literacy shorn gangster trapping godfather sprawling soapoperatic tone sprawl appropriate origin novel mario puzo also cowrote screenplay coppola large cast charactersmaybe large difficult keep track everyone even youve watched film couple time may find scene mobster seem spontaneously appear catch saying wait guy supposed soap opera angle positive negative depending taste tend like soapoperatic story course coppola put yummy gangster topping one make palatable guy like root though godfather concerned realistic depiction dysfunctional family try make lifeincluding marriage birth adultery spat family member tiff others community theory soap opera angle account much film appeal slight lack focus sprawl account much reason barely gave film two thing help film transcend lower score even though gangster stuff far surpassed graphic brutality intervening year dramatic context violence usually give tremendous impact film like ichi killer watched first time night watching godfather make godfather brutality fit sesame street comparison however although ichis violence effective setting knob doesnt make better besides ichi top would make many godfather fan want hurl extent coppola puzo focus extended corleone family create tremendous depth relationship whole film looked fascinating depiction oscillating dynamic family pole pair interactingdistancing controllack control benevolencemalevolence character stance action combination range characteristic everyone dance around pole speak throughout film angle even attractive surface violence well attractive u fan stuff artwork mainly purpose pushing character one pole implication underlying mechanism natural tendency towards achieving dynamic equilibrium superficial stylistic factor help push score also obvious everyone grandparent mentioned performance tough go wrong cast including al pacino marlon brando robert duvall james caan diane keaton another commonly mentioned element agree fantastic superbly integrated create atmosphere nino rota score less often mentioned consistently intriguing cinematography gordon willis willis unusual shot film subtle barely noticeable unless youre looking opening example consists long last minute zoom amerigo bonasera salvatore corsitto shot beautifully litmost frame extremely dark giving bonasera chiaroscuro effect opening also unusual long monologue minor character willis coppola knack placing actor frame create depth interesting visual pattern done slyly first blush wouldnt believe something thought keep mind watching see delightful visual path zigzag wind focal point created confluence actor scenery frame havent seen godfather important thing watching forget greatest film time hype thats likely set expectation could never met likely youll disappointed think one better film one hollywood admirable relatively odder director featuring earlier performance well known cast keep mind much historical family saga crime gangster film

"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.

Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.

The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.

Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.

"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!

The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.

Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.

Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather.

I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)

I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up!

"It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time. I can watch it over again and think its good or great but i think that a movie like this should have 8,0 - 8,4 at imdb. And not 100 on metacritic. Or 97% on rt.

But its a great film that i can watch multiple times. And i like the music. I wouldnt say its bad. I just say that i dont think its worth more than 9 on imdb or a lot of other rewards this movie has got. But i still love it. Its just a little overrated.

Hope this was helpful.

"The Corleone family face a threat to their lives and business.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.

I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.

There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.

Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.

It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.

Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.

The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.",corleone family face threat life business one greatest movie time recently watched th anniversary theatrical release epic cinema experience speaks volume watched multiple time minute still fly little say already covered reviewer movie designed entertainment whilst others artistic expression godfather incredibly well every scene beautifully shot great visual storytelling combine form compelling plot unforgettable presentation character often regarded greatest opening scene character establishment movie history hard disagree another great aspect shot framing al pacino change character michael develops throughout story also shot diane keaton place character kay outside family numerous situation course famous baptism fire sequence despite incredibly dark subject matter truly amazing piece filmmaking pacino marlon brando james caan robert duvall john cazale talia shire richard castellano brilliant along rest cast portray character never like million year cannot help another golden era hollywood filmmaking godfather one best produced
"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.",film contains element genuine masterpiece attention detail history tradition absolutely wonderful screenplay comparative closeness novel storyline became template future story genre performance one single character flaw entire cast continues amaze film fact correct actor actress chosen role chosen perfect point respective career throughout film one actor actress seems old young part anyone including extremely strong diane keaton seem place unconvincing plot storyline could better one film matter many time youve seen still continues amaze entertain way inform like classic preceded hold well time probably continue currently vhs godfather saga first movie woven together chronological order absolutely amazing begin birth vito end eventual rise michael although francis ford coppola like version epic sure wish would release dvd

"Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.

Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.

The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.

As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.

Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure.

"Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.

However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.

Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.

7/10. Average film.

"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).

In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way

The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.

Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.

Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.

Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).

In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.",godfather used hold top spot imdbs top movie list sits number two behind frank darabonts emotionally manipulative crowdpleaser shawshank redemption become goto title people cant arsed think come naming favourite film people clearly arent showing godfather enough respect perhaps need taught lesson capiche opinion francis ford coppola sweeping mafia epic based mario puzas bestselling novel trump shawshank every way film boast superior cast headed marlon brando al pacino excellent support james caan robert duvall tom robbins morgan fairchild simply match coppola storytelling impeccable start finish drawing viewer film inextricably michael corleone pacino drawn sinister violent underworld sicilian organised crime darabont reasonable enough job papering shawshanks plot hole fails lend film sense style class evident every scene godfather nino rota score coppola movie sublime majestic piece music emotive note evoke entire genre cant even recall shawshanks score rather unsurprisingly shawshank redemption deal theme redemption close contrived feelgood ending godfather darker far complex dealing loyalty honour obligation destiny desire vengeance violence love hate trust doesnt sellout sappy happy ending closing instead michael embracing lifestyle sought avoid perfectamundo thats italian perfect possibly short godfather every department
"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.

The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!

The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

"The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.",godfather dont already know corleone mafia family struggling survive war rival family thats simplistic summary get masterpiece there way describe simple line there already ton excellent wellthoughtout review imdb there really little add overwhelming praise film obviously one greatest movie time reputation welldeserved direction cast score script good get whole production flawless youre likely find film isnt thing would change one movie see least die
"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.

For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.

What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.

What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.

And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).

So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...

The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.

What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.",first always heard lot people younger godfather epic movie time always memorized vito corleones face kid year later decided time watch movie netflix oh good sharp chemistry make stuff actor always transcend transcend much vito corleone one best movie character ever performance actor gave one best performance time al pacino michael corleone arguably best performance ever cant say enough marlon brando need state obvious best reason would go forever godfather favourite movie time would word havent watched give try see masterpiece also make godfather special line hero villain one really call calm guy like vito corleone bad guy technically well good bla bla bla go mind challenge always saw vito hero godfather grew thought like antihero michael always anti hero opinion godfather give blend epic character fiction history ever let alone movie

"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.

The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.

The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.

The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets.

"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.

The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.

This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.",one many thing stand test time film rich deeply colored softness image doesnt seem dated fact beautiful way peddling presentation testament artistic framing art godfather along character forbidden outsider world mafia make memorable monument craft filmmaking period detail casting another spot representation larger life character primal environment look actor semiwhispered dialog tightly confined room verboten landscape fact people real realization expectation surprise may best film time claim like one movie taken seriously certainly finely crafted work art influence hardly measured although director came close two godfather movie incredible apocalypse forever noticed creative force behind godfather godfather ii worthy inclusion best film list
"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island.

"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.

A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.

This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.",epic film mafia family called corleones take place family overseen corleone marlon brando son help fatherexcept youngest michael al pacino want part family businessbut might choice fantastic film run three hour youre never bored wonderfully directed francis ford coppola also one rare film perfect castno one bad also fun see pacino james caan robert duvall diane keaton young full life many line ill make offer cant refuse become legendary also violence considered extreme pretty tame today character getting shoot toll booth pretty top favorite scene end keaton realizes shes married look face perfect huge hit box office loved critic public alike rightfully called gone wind masterpiece well worth seeing
"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece, The Godfather stands as a pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, it is arguably the finest gangster drama ever made, setting the standard for the genre and for cinema as a whole. The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and unforgettable performances, particularly by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, create an immersive experience that captures the complex dynamics of power, loyalty, and family. Its influence on filmmaking is profound, inspiring countless directors and shaping the narrative structure and visual style of many subsequent movies.

"I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.

The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.

The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.",honeslty found movie pretty overrated cinematagraphy fantastic dialogue iconic thats take something good movie plot interesting compelling enough last hour pace slow without subtitle much trouble understanding word saying ending really good tension built well none character felt human enough care one character less corrupt amusing personality would less problem sitting around watching movie boring

I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie.

"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.

Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.

The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.

But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.

The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.

In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.

It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.

It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.

Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

10/10

"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.",first word francis coppola organized crime saga believe america spoken wronged father seeking justice mafia vito corleone immigrant passion invoke spirit adapted homeland ironic gesture film embrace american dream vengeance beginning joyful celebration marriage ending solemn catholic church baptism continuing murder bloody murder vengeance punishment severed horse head bed sheet simply leverage film gained notoriety epic display gangland violence real power lie nuance shading phrase deceptive fall lamplight sound footstep hospital stairway credit go cowriters coppola mario puzo leisurely paced tightly plotted screenplay remarkable study contrast showing thin line dividing patriotism graft honor brutality family affection ritual violence seeing part one independent companionsequel like reading middle chapter long complex historical novel rich detail drama immigrant family coping changing time new world result one truly effective adaptation popular novel together part two perhaps last word gangster film drama

"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10.

"I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.

The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.

Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.

This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.

The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.

"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.",ok see movie many naysayer one saw film fifteen time could go film myriad failure contrived selfimportant time even poorly staged brings point lot people seem forget coppola win best director bob fosse cabaret deservedly much better job one eight oscar cabaret wonthe seven happen art direction cinematography sound editingoriginal score best supporting actor best actress time came open envelope announce best picture award go instead film point two statue actor adapted screenplay movie win eight academy award fail grab best picture mind godfather merely arrogant filmmaking history legacybothjust like protagonist downright larcenous

"I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.

From the aspects that have been reviewed, the author states that the film The Godfather truly deserves to be the king of mafia-themed films. The plot is neat and the storyline is not boring. The acting quality of the actors and actresses is not half-hearted. The use of props is also total (that horse's head, you know!) and also music that suits the theme being carried. If The Shawshank Redemption had never existed, perhaps the one that would be in first place right now would be this film.

"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of cinema since its release in 1972. At its core, the film tells the gripping tale of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan navigating loyalty, power, and the complexities of family ties.

One of the most striking aspects of ""The Godfather"" is its meticulous storytelling. The screenplay, based on Mario Puzo's novel, expertly balances the personal and the political, allowing viewers to engage deeply with the characters' motivations and struggles. The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, giving weight to each decision made by its characters, immersing the audience in the intricate dynamics of the mafia underworld.

The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone becoming iconic. Brando brings a blend of gravitas and vulnerability to the role, making the patriarch a figure of both fear and respect. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, transitioning from the reluctant outsider to a central figure in the family's operations, showcasing a powerful character arc that captivates throughout the film.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Gordon Willis uses shadow and light to enhance the film's mood, creating a dark, atmospheric aesthetic that reinforces the themes of secrecy and corruption. The iconic score by Nino Rota complements the film beautifully, adding emotional depth to its memorable scenes.

When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This movie is an epic, in every sense of the word.

Ultimately, ""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of power, morality, and family. Its intricate plot, compelling characters, and artistic craftsmanship make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting the film, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-see cinematic experience that reaffirms its status as the greatest films ever made.

"The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.",best thing say watch movie godfather one thing look stunning strongly disagree previous reviewer said cinematography horrid cinematography one best asset film scene cinematography lighting quite dark mysterious scene wedding evergreen autumnal picturesque cinematography make godfather look stunning costume beautifully tailored house gorgeous majestic look even car immaculate
"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.

Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.",fortunate see godfather back upon theatrical release matter many gangster movie made different kind movie movie foremost family dedication one another could manage ignore fact one new york mafia family set watching model family honoring family patriarch vito corleone memorably played marlon brando time witnessing rise new family leader michael corleone played al pacino equally memorable role santino sonny corleone created james caan memorable robert duvall created quiet role tom hagen many list godfather number one time doesnt matter film meant enjoyed merit regardless probably never gang family movie approach overall impact one coppola directed movie followup great effort one heart shot entirely sound stage look sound cheap consider failure also directed fun movie peggy sue got married another family theme al pacino even though filming still essentially unknown role michael put map still going strong godfather long movie three hour never seems long well told story classic every respect copy belongs library every serious movie fan
"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.

Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.

I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.",tale contempt corruption extortion fraud disruption dinosaur roam testosterone foam street sewer rat run overwhelmingly brilliant performance come marlon brando rest cast essentially play role perpetually play watch subsequent offering work well today im sure survives test time well film era editing jump erratically woman generally treated like brood mare live ignorance surroundings long there good sing song dance cake christening wedding even better fondly remember edward g robinson film better jimmy cagney even george raft best mob villain country mile
"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point.

"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.

The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.

The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.

The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.

The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.

Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.

As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.

Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.",godfather long enjoyed reputation one greatest film time fair assessment rewatching film recently id say yes godfather title vito corleone marlon brando aging head corleone crime family time coming end rival would like precipitate end attempt made don life son follow father footstep seek silence enemy protect family interest oscarwinning script cowritten director francis ford coppola mario puzo author original novel trimmed significantly novel film still clock two hour fortyfive minute film progress stately pace feature countless classic scene coppola direction received welldeserved oscar nomination nino rota score least deemed ineligible gordon willis cinematography good great film evocation attractive authentic actor marlon brando rewarded second best actor oscar iconic portrayal vito corleone al pacino nearly good role vitos youngest son settle nomination supporting category good company though since james caan robert duvall also nominated one three performance would oscarworthy also several memorable performance smaller role like john cazale talia shire sterling hayden others godfather best american film time personally dont think wouldnt rank far top case one film every movie lover see
"Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.

When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.

Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.

The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.

Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.

The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.

In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.

The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.

So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.

Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals.

"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.

Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.

The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film

This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.

The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.

The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.

Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.

Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.

"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.

Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.

To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.",undeniably one finest american motion picture ever made godfather magnificent film beginning would one finest trilogy story grace big screen godfather pitch perfect film many factor mark best film one finest film ever made performance superb one actor place given finest dialog work brando majestic vito performance film may famous well iconic al pacino undeniably star film nowadays usually consist chewing scenery blustering personality dialog shout michael corleone war hero son dragged family business hit attempt father fantastic performance one undisputed best golden era hollywood film making journey character go war hero loving girlfriend head family masterful hard believe actor would go excessive scarface devil advocate brando pacino fantastically supported fine supporting cast robert duvall james cann john cazale diane keaton put superb work film contains finest acting writing directing hollywood film many moment cannot forget horse head scene one disturbing yet brilliantly executed scene ever witness screenplay mario puzo coppola sublime tell wonderful story coppola direction best finally nina rota music without doubt one best music score ever composed film going waltz terrifying orchestra matter minute music score stay forever sum godfather sensational fine film fine filmmaker
"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.

This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films.

"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.

And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.

Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.

Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.

Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.

Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).

Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.

I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

"Greetings from Lithuania.

To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.

There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.

Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.

Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish.

"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.

There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.

Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.

Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone.

"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.

All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.

And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.

The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.

The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.

Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.

Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.",time time friend berate seeing film yet consider something movie buff duly sat saturday night curry director cut entertainment delight say there hour life im never going get back dont get wrong im big fan gangster movie ive studied early cagneyrobinson film seen important one scarface casino goodfellas even stayed awake upon time america godfather agonising slow meandering overlycomplicated lacking punch lashed bullet horse head certainly lacked dynamite watching godfather cinematic equivalent beach boy pet sound year impossible see earth considered groundbreakingly new exciting account coppolla making brave movie reintroducing genre stuck lavishing minute minutia one mafia family lavish thing say defence production design superb lacked nothing overall look film excellent budget must colossal pity plot dialogue didnt live promise cast huge impressive well twice pitiful legendary marlon brando couldnt fail disappoint poor man legend opinion far exceeded talent understand director begged brando come retirement although kind wish hed stayed incessant mumbling padded cheek peering dark corner scratching face turning volume way high becoming increasingly frustrated diane keaton played diane keatonannie hall real name trivia houndsas usual increasingly terrible haircut looked like wasnt sure movie looked like wanted go home relationship pacino totally lacked chemistry found return sicily widower highly unbelievable even pacinos thunderbolt relationship apollonia seemed contrived wooden know he meant hard man remained pokerfaced throughout movie lost feeling sympathy best part felt played james caan whose character labelled hot tempered father take interesting within corleone family course met predictably sticky end like lot better character found lot meandering plot predictable extent annoying diehard fan put show couldnt help something tell apollonia isnt going get car etc plot didnt really go anywhere seemed setting sequel every minute brandopacino inviting people take advantage offer couldnt refuse laughable caans none character slightest bit appealing outrageous behaviour tommy scorsese goodfellas example counterbalanced likable personality youre laughing spite pacinos protagonist scarface snorting copious amount cocaine waving gun around still care guy however monstrous he become pacino godfather cartoon badass like rest identikit baddie depth whatsoever remorse weakness humanity growth brando stumble death among tomato plant play grandson take mean coppolla showing u vito heart really little late coppolla may well brave reintroduce decidedly unfashionable genre conservative audience time might breath fresh air glamour pace subsequent better gangster fare put godfather shade however responsible film may genre future output
"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece.

"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.

The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order.""",godfather endless movie matter age discovered number time seen work lose ability fascination mystery problem talk limited amount praise expertise justifies either wonderful performance brando vito corleone evoked note modulation dialogue play cat three interview first sequence character defined tormented role pacino michael corleone war hero work require take place crime family impulsive character james caan counterpart reflective tom hagen play robert duvall accuracy smallest side corresponding name italian sollozzo tattaglia ribbon structure wise feel nearly three hour also exemplary could considered godfather organized around collective sequence religiousfamily marriage connie sunny sequence film sicilian intermediate achieved justly celebrated baptismslaughter disease death vito playing grandson among vine another anthology moment rest come await arrival violence unrelenting brutality shooting sonny foot house tribute coppola arthur penn bonnie clyde premiere michael restaurant riddled body stabbed dismembered strangled blunt kind feast degraded meat without mafia order
"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes.",movie directed wonderfully dialog good dont even know hour passed away al pacinos acting take movie whole another level good news godfather many amazing quality including fantastic performance unprecedented visuals engaging story bad news easily overall sprawling unfocused cant possibly give earns asset transcend whats basically mess overallalthough cinematography production design great really impressed darkly lit scene character feature set emerge pitchblackness everything rich deep shade burgundy brown orange amazingly nothing get lost scene

"This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.

On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.

The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.

As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.

Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made.",excellent movie great actor great scene great storyline one complaint lot material covered book movie without giving away much story many booksmore like part book godfather novel book ii focusing johnny fontaine exclusion part arent focus main character extremely close adaptation novel word word many sense epically near begging movie al pachino top movie steal show brando great also robert duvol tom hagen wonderfulthis one best movie ever made
"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".

If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.

Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.",rarely said film defined genre never true case godfather since release epic garnered ten academy award nomination named best picture gangster movie judged standard one unfair comparison may film jewish mobster jewish godfather chinese underworld oriental godfather take place contemporary time modern day godfather godfather guntoting mafia type would never garnered many accolade characteristic set film apart many predecessor successor ability weave oftendisparate layer story cohesive whole individual issue explored godfather strong enough form foundation movie however bolstered many complimentary theme given added resonance picture series miniclimaxes building devastating definitive conclusion rarely film tell many diverseyetinterconnected story strong performance solid directing tightlyplotted script contribute godfather success motion picture slapped together satiate appetite mass carefully painstakingly crafted every major character minor one molded distinct complex individual stereotype influence coppola film although certain one formed result

"Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.

Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.

Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.

When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.

"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.",take gangster film dip sepia tone wrap nino rota elegiac score add soap sentiment youve got godfather gone wind gangster film like gwtw godfather represents oldstyle hollywood filmmaking popular masterpiece goodfellas soprano make seem almost antiquated coppola direction attempt sweeping script character shallow predictable scaled epic film slow moving talky several character sequence feel dispensable film doesnt really deepen build excitement progress despite talk family member corleone family essentially stock character pacino shire cazales caan dont bond family patriarch commanding even likable figure would inspire love loyalty morgana king mama barely exists though netted oscar brandos largely immobile performance gimmicky really supporting role term screen time godfather story michael corleone film owned brilliant al pacino support caan keaton duvall pretty much onenote godfather acknowledged film classic became cultural touchstone inspired imitation parodiesit medium event box office phenomenon swept oscar brandos sending sasheen littlefeather refuse oscar added legend
"Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.

The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.

"I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.

This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.",realize considered classic many people one alive saw pre nostalgic place still keep movie alive even modern era understand however one grows seeing movie like goodfellas movie last year seeing old time movie come across like joke acting overall structure laughably bad marlon brandos acting sooo hilariously bad marble cotton ball whatever shoved cheek ridiculously top voice bad hilarious movie classic time give break dont believe anyone modern era see movie actually enjoys pretend like everyone else theyre nothing fraud pretending cultured appreciating older cinema said appreciate time one must really suspend disbelief pretend worthy compared among movie last year

"Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.

For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.

This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.

My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.",part reason godfather popular first viewing really seem something everyone thriller fascinating documentary mafia code half way minute tragic love story starter acting sensational people earth cannot identify marlon brandos whispering horse voice bulldog expression become probably famous performance hollywood history appearance al pacino starring role also highlight highlight course sound byte anyone scene masterpiece give famous quote away instantly recognisable heard movie split three part crime family consequence exile pacino reunion family character carry part plot set u sequel criticism film long winded virtually three hour long meticulous becomes hard digest sequel deep thoughtful try balance intellect action although certain extent succeeds wonder film would enjoyable experience less discussion plot detail thrill
"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever.",argued tom hank youve got mail godfather meet vital question come way life although reason never would eat orange every time someone take one citrus play film every chance perish maybe film begin without credit speech initial nine word patriotism immigration business honor belief hard reality blend believe america america made fortune fail final climax even high treasonthe michael corleone take belief family oneselfcan bad coppola lived limit set constant feeling going fired producer robert evans paramount giving truce would leave finish film believe beginning end day something far removed life mafia based bestseller pressure came juice talent essence inspired new hollywood marlon brando test hired refused young boy came interpretation al pacino john cazale made five film dying cancer five job diane keaton james caan robert de niro reinforcement second part neither music nino rota photography gordon willis second weakness love say offer could refuse think get bed enemy head horse reason many others godfather best movie ever
"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.

If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it.",opinion one best best movie ever done francis ford copolla great job want watch actor picked carefully good couldnt imagine others playing character movie portrays sicilian mafia problem godfather face pretty perfect compared gangster movie like goodfellas example godfather definitely longer interesting story havent watched definitely minute running time movie quite long promise worth

The Godfather (1972)

Director - Francis Ford Coppola

Cast - Marlon Brando & Al Pacino

Based on the Classic novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo, this movie is a resounding masterpiece in the field of arts & entertainment. So what makes it the greatest movie ever made. Is it the background score that stirs your soul every time it plays. Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character's journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche. Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to. Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone & furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone. I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts & Entertainment got their A game on & filled it with so much of class, passion, performance & excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema.",godfather director francis ford coppola cast marlon brando al pacino based classic novel godfather mario puzo movie resounding masterpiece field art entertainment make greatest movie ever made background score stir soul every time play detailed direction master coppola take character journey timeline also help unravel deep rooted mystery human psyche alluring cinematography gordon willis make every frame movie look like fascinating visual human eye ever stand witness masterclass acting given brando iconic vito corleone furthermore even better performance al pacino best role acting career also iconic character ever created celluloid michael corleone guess problem film creative genius field art entertainment got game filled much class passion performance excellence film option best film world cinema

"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.

Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.

Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.

The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.

It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.",best movie ever opinion see sayers get godfather rather ground breaking film time rather bold film still cinematic masterpiece everyone keep raving coppola best film apocalypse something extremely hard top compare two style directing different almost look like shot two different director godfather biggest issue poorly made editing unnecessarily lengthened scene totally unnecessary scene expect film something ive heard even director frustrated scene linger screen without evidence director really knew wanted end producer decided amp film material best thing film acting there way denying film show people think marlon brando one greatest actor history film showed u genius al pacino time since ive seen part remember liking better ive always thought vast improvement first one
"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.

There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.",thought book overdone corny read thought movie overacted bordered fantasy saw spent year major city police department occasion deal mob type nothing like portrayed film hollow shell men somehow know bravado sham good action scene picture find constant atmosphere universal admiration thuggery aimed juvenile patron
"""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film!

"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.

Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:

I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'",film open last saturday august japanese surrendered opening scene film camera slowly pull back face man corleones dark home office regally ruthlessly hold court carry crime family business daughter wedding reception held bright sunshiny outdoor veranda long island compound according corleones irishgerman overseer surrogate son tom hagen robert duvall part wedding sicilian refuse request daughter wedding day custom father bride grant favor promise petitioner supplicant pay homage seated front don desk undertaker named amerigo bonasera salvatore corsitto speaking heavy accent vito corleones wife godmother bonaseras daughter bonasera desperately pleads favor proper vengeful justice rather american justice threatened nearrape brutal beating suffered daughter raised american fashion nonitalian boyfriend friend two brute received court date suspended sentence believe america america made fortune raised daughter american fashion gave freedom taught never dishonor family found boyfriend italiantwo month ago took drive another boyfriend made drink whiskey tried take advantage resisted kept honor beat like animalshe light life beautiful girl never beautiful againii went police like good american two boy brought trial judge sentenced three year prison suspended sentence suspended sentence went free day stood courtroom like fool two bastard smiled said wife justice must go corleone
"This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing.

"This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.

The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.",tell movie famous tell movie parody enjambé storyline tell one movie quoted much answer cant movie much impact godfather ever since released acting simply amazing else could say could appealing peopleeven today watching actor like al pacino marlon brando james caan diane keaton talia shire robert duvall like heaven someone fan movie movie brando able bring back limelight performance godfather alone iconic character recreated much film almost already become cliché performance though cliché performance subtle breathtaking genuine realistic probably definitely genuine marlon brando al pacino perfect film well way start career character depth displayed perfectly able display innerbattles mind well battle family friend enemy character psychological character study anything else robert duvall glue movie added different perspective everything italian yet respect mafia character man high authority within corleone family listened insightful simply perfect giving film great balance throughout rest cast icing cake writing phenomenal breathtaking mentioned movie quoted even quote though make writing perfect symbolism meaning went every scene countless symbol message line memorable yet realistic movie could get directing coppola perfect well many movie hour yet maintain good level interest audience like godfather coppola deserves credit symbolism message went every scene also directing writing movie well edited strung together word could come mind perfection cinematography music perfect score movie one memorable ever hear could identify right away cinematography actually really drove movie godfather seems mystique give feeling watching something truly remarkable
"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...

"I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike. Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed. And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid. The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them.

"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting.",francis ford coppola screen adaptation mario puzos novel godfather cinematic master piece thought provoking irony shroud film leaf audience astounded excellence work character dynamic go extensive amount growth throughout duration film use irony antithesis juxtaposition create complex story surface although movie complex layered difficult follow long want get experience recommend watching installment rather make movie easier follow keep attention span fresh lot violence overly gory tasteful film tarantino nature leave gun behind grab cannoli enjoy exemplary film full plot grade acting
"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.

The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema. And is the question: is the best movie ever? When we stop to think about days after seeing the movie we were in doubt, but to watch no doubt of the answer. Almost like an offer we can't refuse.

"I decided to give this movie a go after seeing it in the #2 spot in the IMDB top 250 list.

This movie establishes the characters well, and all of the acting in this movie seemed top notch, with even small character roles being portrayed convincingly throughout the film.

Unfortunately, a large portion of the film contained long scenes that caused me to rapidly lose attention or become sleepy. The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.

The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa.",decided give movie go seeing spot imdb top list movie establishes character well acting movie seemed top notch even small character role portrayed convincingly throughout film unfortunately large portion film contained long scene caused rapidly lose attention become sleepy excessive amount time eg first min wedding well set pace film instead lulling audience dozy stupor many viewer would tempted jump phone notable part movie part action happens tense encounter police chief scene boom gate emotional garden scene dongrandson noteworthy part film cast finally given chance flex talent unfortunately agree many low reviewer summary say movie overrated may great movie even movie less likely earn star review likely give three hour nap sofa
"The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him.",godfather great noir style gangster movie also tale immigrant came country last part depression poor family europe came land free find wealth controlled land baron banker well like parent vito corleone raise family never wanted life son realizing word lost sonny fredo sickly child much hope making michael different went college service ww never supposed world attempt father life make realize father son swears revenge salatso police captain protects story unravels great performance brando caan pacinoduvallwith incredible supporting cast abe vigodarichard castalano diane keaton talia shire perhaps best supporting cast john cazale fredo supposedly brightest bulb bunch turn good schemer want whats coming

"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day.

"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!",im gonna write another review great flawless godfather already lot pretty much everyone know perfect movie instead im gonna share year old guy view masterpiece thus ill highlight importance first thing first yes like blockbuster kind movie know type ive absolutely adored cinema brought past year ive seen many movie s unlike generation say fond especially happy exception said cant imagine big movie nd favorite time movie ive seen pacing incredible picture meant timeless sound captivating plot classic dont get started performance marlon brando greatest actor walked earth proved best maybe best performance time id seen streetcar waterfront could believe eye shame rating truly least even objective voting generation spends buck hour explosion every summer another useless moneymaker movie never know greatness hour epic true masterpiece

"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather.",perfect film ever released perfect every aspect scene almost feel like masterpiece case coppola revolutionary godfather statement hold especially true phenomenal sheer brilliance every aspect cannot matched modern cinema coppola godfather cinematic perfection every aspect filmmaking performance delivered astounding ensemble cast nina rota breathtakingly soaring epic musical score coppola direction godfather essentially viewed three hour masterclass filmmaking aspiring filmmaker perfect every aspect free flaw film since time matched even half brilliance godfather
"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",past pm finished watching francis ford coppola godfather probably go bed late tomorrow wake bit early early enough postpone writing line seen three time opportunity sharing thought refreshed insight much good offer sit bear film work well take place underworld embedded even observe coppola put u straight smackdab center admittedly society made criminal criminal also reason welcoming surrounded inhabitantscoldblooded murderer men see crime like job masquerading honorable men mean men outside would witness horrifying disturbing manifestation wellthought action go even deeper revolves around corleone family led vito corleone marlon brando honest men sitting right edge people like fully embrace world easy avoids conflict absolutely necessary man defined moral principle scene beginning daughter wedding day one associate luca brasi lenny montana practice speech going give meet scene two funny almost adorable could help sympathize realize feeling warmth two mobster even mention lenny montana actual mob hitman actually nervous said line watched realized incredibly complex ruthless society power corrupt anyone come contact best example corleones youngest son michael al pacino return home sister wedding war hero dressed part longtime girlfriend kay adam diane keaton first avoids underworld necessity firsthand exposure sheer devilish appealing nature draw get film change shocking every outsider ever got close tainted one way another survive drawn well viewer inside coppola expose family u fully bold personal approach witness every discussion every methodically calculated choice crime done simply nature business put chair alongside easily relate u good guy rival family bad guy greatest feat film managed pull offset apart good guy bad guy world filled bad guy film unmatched subtlety movie sustains good film done precision attention completeness many layer probably missed maybe never notice felt director francis ford coppola partner crime poor choice word sorry mario puzo nothing short timeless piece reference cinema whose influence based reinventing wheel rather perfecting absolute maximum masterpiece remembered historical contribution citizen kane brought biggest stepup art form thing gone wind space odyssey godfather one film remembered simply good cannot possibly imagine greater achievement

"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.",masterclass film making godfather contender best film time id argue case ultimate gangster movie panic thought film almost three hour long neednt wont even notice time fly production value incredible look sublime whole way well produced roughly fifty year old put many new film shame brandon pacino castellano incredible performance could add whole lot youre considering buying hard copy would recommend blu ray sharper dvd difference film huge influence year still forever one greatest
"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",acting simply amazing else could say could appealing peopleeven today watching actor like al pacino marlon brando james caan diane keaton talia shire robert duvall like heaven someone fan movie movie brando able bring back limelight performance godfather alone iconic character recreated much film almost already become cliché performance though cliché performance subtle breathtaking genuine realistic probably definitely genuine marlon brando al pacino perfect film well way start career character depth displayed perfectly able display innerbattles mind well battle family friend enemy character psychological character study anything else robert duvall glue movie added different perspective everything italian yet respect mafia character man high authority within corleone family listened insightful simply perfect giving film great balance throughout rest cast icing cake writing phenomenal breathtaking mentioned movie quoted even quote though make writing perfect symbolism meaning went every scene countless symbol message line memorable yet realistic movie could get
"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",godfather quite simply masterful piece filmmaking epic truest sense word far finest gangster film ever shot made finesse style spare director elicits pitchperfect performance talented cast moviemaking yes long film yes section quite slow nevertheless none film less riveting story fatherson takeover one new york major italian mafia family fairly straight forward yet francis ford coppola turn something else much meditation human condition perhaps certainly film explores darker side humanity jealousy betrayal anger revenge key theme film inevitably punctuated moment graphic shocking violence im glad coppola chooses shy away said violence make gritty realistic happen marlon brando take showrunner role patriarch who past prime easy spot real star piece al pacino burn screen sheer ferocity robert duvall easy miss quieter part watch james caan whose volatile sonny one film engaging character altogether splendid unforgettable piece filmmaking inevitably spawned sequel whole gamut similar gangster fare godfather tower head shoulder
"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",today havent bothered review godfather everyone pretty much know one greatest film ever made imdbs top best picture oscar nearly review imdb whats one review well completing review nut guess time got around reviewing film reviewed long time ago goesthe film perfect dope wouldnt watch unfortunately imdb requires say meet line minimum review ill point need like gangster film enjoy film yes violent nasty spotsbut also brilliantly written produced start finish deserves accolade received advice instead watching godfather godfather part ii see combined version created televisionwith additional scene made rich experience
"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.",im year old first time ive watched godfather feel like ive missed something like definitely enjoyed film dragged way longer shouldve definitely pointless scene understand way ahead time im obviously watching year late reason believe didnt enjoy much rest read rest review old film actually really enjoyed dont blame youth ill definitely watch second one aswell point im sure ill really like one ive seen film ive given way better marlon oscar best leading role think shouldve best supporting role al pacino shouldve put oscar marlon wasnt film nearly much thought hed definitely wasnt bad film fact good film thats good film

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away.

"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito.

"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.

I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.

The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film.

"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.

The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.

The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.

"The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.

Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.

The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.

With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.

This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10.",godfather strong contender best film ever made id argue ultimate gangster movie dont worry nearly threehour runtime wont even notice time passing fly production value astounding visual appeal remains impressive throughout around fifty year old outshines many modern film performance brando pacino castellano among others acting phenomenal youre considering hard copy recommend bluray version sharper dvd difference noticeable film significant influence year always one greatest

"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.

For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.",im ready downvoted oblivion intellectually appreciate style influence popularity film attested lasting reputation universally positive review along classic like battleship potemkin metropolis massive impact lauded masterpiece yet like film think value piece film history emotional viewing experience put bluntly see masterpiece time dont feel way watch sure ill give plenty credit acting atmosphere cinematographic technique add soft dreamlike quality everything portrayal gangster seemed far know grounded humanistic caricatured however definitely part drag didnt feel engaging watched expectation idea status id probably think well made film older era nothing earthshattering
"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.

Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.

Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.

Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.

So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.

"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time.

"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972.

"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.

The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.

Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.

But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.

To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.

But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.

Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).

Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.",marlon brando vito corleone head perhaps powerful new yorkarea mafia family wellrespected film directorwriter francis ford coppola film begin vito receiving business guest office home daughter connies talia shire wedding reception taking place epic plot take place many year telling story vito familyincluding michael al pacino santino james caan tom hagen robert duvall associate interaction mob syndicate godfather commonly considered one greatest film time even though ive given wouldnt put kind exalted emphasis ive given literally thousand film year godfather barely made think number flaw coppola also knack transcending problem brilliant move another rate definitely mustsee viewingeven highly regardedif youve experienced film yet think good idea attain cultural literacy film popularly loved godfather become necessary element achieving literacy shorn gangster trapping godfather sprawling soapoperatic tone sprawl appropriate origin novel mario puzo also cowrote screenplay coppola large cast charactersmaybe large difficult keep track everyone even youve watched film couple time may find scene mobster seem spontaneously appear catch saying wait guy supposed soap opera angle positive negative depending taste tend like soapoperatic story course coppola put yummy gangster topping one make palatable guy like root though godfather concerned realistic depiction dysfunctional family try make lifeincluding marriage birth adultery spat family member tiff others community theory soap opera angle account much film appeal slight lack focus sprawl account much reason barely gave film two thing help film transcend lower score even though gangster stuff far surpassed graphic brutality intervening year dramatic context violence usually give tremendous impact film like ichi killer watched first time night watching godfather make godfather brutality fit sesame street comparison however although ichis violence effective setting knob doesnt make better besides ichi top would make many godfather fan want hurl extent coppola puzo focus extended corleone family create tremendous depth relationship whole film looked fascinating depiction oscillating dynamic family pole pair interactingdistancing controllack control benevolencemalevolence character stance action combination range characteristic everyone dance around pole speak throughout film angle even attractive surface violence well attractive u fan stuff artwork mainly purpose pushing character one pole implication underlying mechanism natural tendency towards achieving dynamic equilibrium superficial stylistic factor help push score also obvious everyone grandparent mentioned performance tough go wrong cast including al pacino marlon brando robert duvall james caan diane keaton another commonly mentioned element agree fantastic superbly integrated create atmosphere nino rota score less often mentioned consistently intriguing cinematography gordon willis willis unusual shot film subtle barely noticeable unless youre looking opening example consists long last minute zoom amerigo bonasera salvatore corsitto shot beautifully litmost frame extremely dark giving bonasera chiaroscuro effect opening also unusual long monologue minor character willis coppola knack placing actor frame create depth interesting visual pattern done slyly first blush wouldnt believe something thought keep mind watching see delightful visual path zigzag wind focal point created confluence actor scenery frame havent seen godfather important thing watching forget greatest film time hype thats likely set expectation could never met likely youll disappointed think one better film one hollywood admirable relatively odder director featuring earlier performance well known cast keep mind much historical family saga crime gangster film
"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.

There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.

"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.

Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.

The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.

Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.

"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!

The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.

Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.

Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather.

I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)

I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up!

"It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time. I can watch it over again and think its good or great but i think that a movie like this should have 8,0 - 8,4 at imdb. And not 100 on metacritic. Or 97% on rt.

But its a great film that i can watch multiple times. And i like the music. I wouldnt say its bad. I just say that i dont think its worth more than 9 on imdb or a lot of other rewards this movie has got. But i still love it. Its just a little overrated.

Hope this was helpful.

"The Corleone family face a threat to their lives and business.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.

I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.

There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.

Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.

It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.

Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.

The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.",corleone family face threat life business one greatest movie time recently watched th anniversary theatrical release epic cinema experience speaks volume watched multiple time minute still fly little say already covered reviewer movie designed entertainment whilst others artistic expression godfather incredibly well every scene beautifully shot great visual storytelling combine form compelling plot unforgettable presentation character often regarded greatest opening scene character establishment movie history hard disagree another great aspect shot framing al pacino change character michael develops throughout story also shot diane keaton place character kay outside family numerous situation course famous baptism fire sequence despite incredibly dark subject matter truly amazing piece filmmaking pacino marlon brando james caan robert duvall john cazale talia shire richard castellano brilliant along rest cast portray character never like million year cannot help another golden era hollywood filmmaking godfather one best produced
"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.",film contains element genuine masterpiece attention detail history tradition absolutely wonderful screenplay comparative closeness novel storyline became template future story genre performance one single character flaw entire cast continues amaze film fact correct actor actress chosen role chosen perfect point respective career throughout film one actor actress seems old young part anyone including extremely strong diane keaton seem place unconvincing plot storyline could better one film matter many time youve seen still continues amaze entertain way inform like classic preceded hold well time probably continue currently vhs godfather saga first movie woven together chronological order absolutely amazing begin birth vito end eventual rise michael although francis ford coppola like version epic sure wish would release dvd

"Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.

Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.

The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.

As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.

Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure.

"Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.

However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.

Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.

"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).

In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way

The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.

Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.

Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.

Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).

In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.",godfather used hold top spot imdbs top movie list sits number two behind frank darabonts emotionally manipulative crowdpleaser shawshank redemption become goto title people cant arsed think come naming favourite film people clearly arent showing godfather enough respect perhaps need taught lesson capiche opinion francis ford coppola sweeping mafia epic based mario puzas bestselling novel trump shawshank every way film boast superior cast headed marlon brando al pacino excellent support james caan robert duvall tom robbins morgan fairchild simply match coppola storytelling impeccable start finish drawing viewer film inextricably michael corleone pacino drawn sinister violent underworld sicilian organised crime darabont reasonable enough job papering shawshanks plot hole fails lend film sense style class evident every scene godfather nino rota score coppola movie sublime majestic piece music emotive note evoke entire genre cant even recall shawshanks score rather unsurprisingly shawshank redemption deal theme redemption close contrived feelgood ending godfather darker far complex dealing loyalty honour obligation destiny desire vengeance violence love hate trust doesnt sellout sappy happy ending closing instead michael embracing lifestyle sought avoid perfectamundo thats italian perfect possibly short godfather every department
"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.

The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!

The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

"The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.",godfather dont already know corleone mafia family struggling survive war rival family thats simplistic summary get masterpiece there way describe simple line there already ton excellent wellthoughtout review imdb there really little add overwhelming praise film obviously one greatest movie time reputation welldeserved direction cast score script good get whole production flawless youre likely find film isnt thing would change one movie see least die
"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.

For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.

What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.

What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.

And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).

So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...

The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.

What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.",first always heard lot people younger godfather epic movie time always memorized vito corleones face kid year later decided time watch movie netflix oh good sharp chemistry make stuff actor always transcend transcend much vito corleone one best movie character ever performance actor gave one best performance time al pacino michael corleone arguably best performance ever cant say enough marlon brando need state obvious best reason would go forever godfather favourite movie time would word havent watched give try see masterpiece also make godfather special line hero villain one really call calm guy like vito corleone bad guy technically well good bla bla bla go mind challenge always saw vito hero godfather grew thought like antihero michael always anti hero opinion godfather give blend epic character fiction history ever let alone movie

It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.

I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie.

"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.

The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.

The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.

The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.",mafia always seen evil secretive interesting enough story came godfather today countless movie television show take place gangster mafia great risk must francis ford coppola adapt mario puzos bestseller big screen succeeded two area believe important film acting writing screenplay coppola puzo one tightest carefully constructed script movie film take place completely within world corleone family never asked hate people sympathize yet due countless scene involving eating drinking talking minute wedding scene beginning set mood tone showing people taken advantage american dream know care happens despite fact evil acting powerful effective impossible think anyone could filled role instead al pacino hated producer loved coppola play michael straight emotionless blank stare say everything nothing along see change change heart personality amazing development whole film james caan perfect hotheaded sonny robert duvall perfect levelheaded tom hagen course marlon brando overtakes everyone aging patriarch vito corleone brando usually considered greatest actor ever go full length portraying man america life growing weary direction business seems going godfather one best film ever fact able suck completely world long never plod always build every scene indeed early scene somewhat setup something later actor play straight smooth everything completely convincing gordon willis dark moody photography add drama evoking hidden agenda secret nino rota composed one famous movie theme seems tell u life going get bad listened vito film put coppola map made director reckon like corleones
"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.

The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.

This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.",one many thing stand test time film rich deeply colored softness image doesnt seem dated fact beautiful way peddling presentation testament artistic framing art godfather along character forbidden outsider world mafia make memorable monument craft filmmaking period detail casting another spot representation larger life character primal environment look actor semiwhispered dialog tightly confined room verboten landscape fact people real realization expectation surprise may best film time claim like one movie taken seriously certainly finely crafted work art influence hardly measured although director came close two godfather movie incredible apocalypse forever noticed creative force behind godfather godfather ii worthy inclusion best film list
"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island.

"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.

A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.

This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.",epic film mafia family called corleones take place family overseen corleone marlon brando son help fatherexcept youngest michael al pacino want part family businessbut might choice fantastic film run three hour youre never bored wonderfully directed francis ford coppola also one rare film perfect castno one bad also fun see pacino james caan robert duvall diane keaton young full life many line ill make offer cant refuse become legendary also violence considered extreme pretty tame today character getting shoot toll booth pretty top favorite scene end keaton realizes shes married look face perfect huge hit box office loved critic public alike rightfully called gone wind masterpiece well worth seeing
"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece, The Godfather stands as a pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, it is arguably the finest gangster drama ever made, setting the standard for the genre and for cinema as a whole. The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and unforgettable performances, particularly by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, create an immersive experience that captures the complex dynamics of power, loyalty, and family. Its influence on filmmaking is profound, inspiring countless directors and shaping the narrative structure and visual style of many subsequent movies. With its haunting score, iconic lines, and meticulously crafted scenes, The Godfather transcends its genre to become a cultural landmark, forever etched in the annals of film history.",one best film time absolute masterpiece godfather stand pinnacle cinematic achievement directed legendary francis ford coppola based mario puzos novel arguably finest gangster drama ever made setting standard genre cinema whole film intricate storytelling rich character development unforgettable performance particularly marlon brando al pacino create immersive experience capture complex dynamic power loyalty family influence filmmaking profound inspiring countless director shaping narrative structure visual style many subsequent movie haunting score iconic line meticulously crafted scene godfather transcends genre become cultural landmark forever etched annals film history
"I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.

The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.

The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.",honeslty found movie pretty overrated cinematagraphy fantastic dialogue iconic thats take something good movie plot interesting compelling enough last hour pace slow without subtitle much trouble understanding word saying ending really good tension built well none character felt human enough care one character less corrupt amusing personality would less problem sitting around watching movie boring

I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie.

"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.

Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.

The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.

But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.

The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.

In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.

It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.

It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.

Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

10/10

"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.",first word francis coppola organized crime saga believe america spoken wronged father seeking justice mafia vito corleone immigrant passion invoke spirit adapted homeland ironic gesture film embrace american dream vengeance beginning joyful celebration marriage ending solemn catholic church baptism continuing murder bloody murder vengeance punishment severed horse head bed sheet simply leverage film gained notoriety epic display gangland violence real power lie nuance shading phrase deceptive fall lamplight sound footstep hospital stairway credit go cowriters coppola mario puzo leisurely paced tightly plotted screenplay remarkable study contrast showing thin line dividing patriotism graft honor brutality family affection ritual violence seeing part one independent companionsequel like reading middle chapter long complex historical novel rich detail drama immigrant family coping changing time new world result one truly effective adaptation popular novel together part two perhaps last word gangster film drama

This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere.

"I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.

The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.

Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.

This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.

The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.

"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.",ok see movie many naysayer one saw film fifteen time could go film myriad failure contrived selfimportant time even poorly staged brings point lot people seem forget coppola win best director bob fosse cabaret deservedly much better job one eight oscar cabaret wonthe seven happen art direction cinematography sound editingoriginal score best supporting actor best actress time came open envelope announce best picture award go instead film point two statue actor adapted screenplay movie win eight academy award fail grab best picture mind godfather merely arrogant filmmaking history legacybothjust like protagonist downright larcenous

"I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.

From the aspects that have been reviewed, the author states that the film The Godfather truly deserves to be the king of mafia-themed films. The plot is neat and the storyline is not boring. The acting quality of the actors and actresses is not half-hearted. The use of props is also total (that horse's head, you know!) and also music that suits the theme being carried.

"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of cinema since its release in 1972. At its core, the film tells the gripping tale of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan navigating loyalty, power, and the complexities of family ties.

One of the most striking aspects of ""The Godfather"" is its meticulous storytelling. The screenplay, based on Mario Puzo's novel, expertly balances the personal and the political, allowing viewers to engage deeply with the characters' motivations and struggles. The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, giving weight to each decision made by its characters, immersing the audience in the intricate dynamics of the mafia underworld.

The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone becoming iconic. Brando brings a blend of gravitas and vulnerability to the role, making the patriarch a figure of both fear and respect. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, transitioning from the reluctant outsider to a central figure in the family's operations, showcasing a powerful character arc that captivates throughout the film.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Gordon Willis uses shadow and light to enhance the film's mood, creating a dark, atmospheric aesthetic that reinforces the themes of secrecy and corruption. The iconic score by Nino Rota complements the film beautifully, adding emotional depth to its memorable scenes.

When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This movie is an epic, in every sense of the word.

Ultimately, ""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of power, morality, and family. Its intricate plot, compelling characters, and artistic craftsmanship make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting the film, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-see cinematic experience that reaffirms its status as the greatest films ever made.

"The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.",best thing say watch movie godfather one thing look stunning strongly disagree previous reviewer said cinematography horrid cinematography one best asset film scene cinematography lighting quite dark mysterious scene wedding evergreen autumnal picturesque cinematography make godfather look stunning costume beautifully tailored house gorgeous majestic look even car immaculate
"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.

Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.",fortunate see godfather back upon theatrical release matter many gangster movie made different kind movie movie foremost family dedication one another could manage ignore fact one new york mafia family set watching model family honoring family patriarch vito corleone memorably played marlon brando time witnessing rise new family leader michael corleone played al pacino equally memorable role santino sonny corleone created james caan memorable robert duvall created quiet role tom hagen many list godfather number one time doesnt matter film meant enjoyed merit regardless probably never gang family movie approach overall impact one coppola directed movie followup great effort one heart shot entirely sound stage look sound cheap consider failure also directed fun movie peggy sue got married another family theme al pacino even though filming still essentially unknown role michael put map still going strong godfather long movie three hour never seems long well told story classic every respect copy belongs library every serious movie fan
"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.

Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.

I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.",tale contempt corruption extortion fraud disruption dinosaur roam testosterone foam street sewer rat run overwhelmingly brilliant performance come marlon brando rest cast essentially play role perpetually play watch subsequent offering work well today im sure survives test time well film era editing jump erratically woman generally treated like brood mare live ignorance surroundings long there good sing song dance cake christening wedding even better fondly remember edward g robinson film better jimmy cagney even george raft best mob villain country mile
"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest.

"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.

The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.

The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.

The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.

The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.

Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.

As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.

Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.",godfather long enjoyed reputation one greatest film time fair assessment rewatching film recently id say yes godfather title vito corleone marlon brando aging head corleone crime family time coming end rival would like precipitate end attempt made don life son follow father footstep seek silence enemy protect family interest oscarwinning script cowritten director francis ford coppola mario puzo author original novel trimmed significantly novel film still clock two hour fortyfive minute film progress stately pace feature countless classic scene coppola direction received welldeserved oscar nomination nino rota score least deemed ineligible gordon willis cinematography good great film evocation attractive authentic actor marlon brando rewarded second best actor oscar iconic portrayal vito corleone al pacino nearly good role vitos youngest son settle nomination supporting category good company though since james caan robert duvall also nominated one three performance would oscarworthy also several memorable performance smaller role like john cazale talia shire sterling hayden others godfather best american film time personally dont think wouldnt rank far top case one film every movie lover see
"Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.

When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.

Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.

The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.

Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.

The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.

In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.

The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.

So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.

Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals.

"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.

Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.

The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film

This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.

The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.

The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.

Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.

Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.

"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.

Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.

To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.",undeniably one finest american motion picture ever made godfather magnificent film beginning would one finest trilogy story grace big screen godfather pitch perfect film many factor mark best film one finest film ever made performance superb one actor place given finest dialog work brando majestic vito performance film may famous well iconic al pacino undeniably star film nowadays usually consist chewing scenery blustering personality dialog shout michael corleone war hero son dragged family business hit attempt father fantastic performance one undisputed best golden era hollywood film making journey character go war hero loving girlfriend head family masterful hard believe actor would go excessive scarface devil advocate brando pacino fantastically supported fine supporting cast robert duvall james cann john cazale diane keaton put superb work film contains finest acting writing directing hollywood film many moment cannot forget horse head scene one disturbing yet brilliantly executed scene ever witness screenplay mario puzo coppola sublime tell wonderful story coppola direction best finally nina rota music without doubt one best music score ever composed film going waltz terrifying orchestra matter minute music score stay forever sum godfather sensational fine film fine filmmaker
"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.

This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films.

"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.

And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.

Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.

Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.

Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.

Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).

Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.

I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.

"Greetings from Lithuania.

To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.

There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.

Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.

Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.",greeting lithuania call godfather masterpiece classic would underestimating simply put one best best motion picture ever created saw movie time never get tired time pass kinda feel need revisit isnt anything new could say picture wasnt said countless time everything work level creates rich deep unforgettable world whole trilogy part favorite mile nd rd movie great term first one another level acting directing writing music music set design thing beauty admiration movie crafting art overall probably already seen masterpiece recommend forget long time revisit contains everything educated cinemagoer wish unforgettable one kind motion picture probably like great wine keep getting better year
"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.

There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.

Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.

Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.",even need said godfather amazing film really purpose pointing thing make wonderful everybody know everybody always know film live forever story performance cinematography musicall perfect woven together wonderfully director francis ford coppola created true classic many good reason film always remembered fondly matter many time see film never fails make impact even youve seen film often essentially memorized line line shot shot remains thrilling experience famous opening scene marlon brandos vito corleone receiving request favor occasion daughter wedding way end final settling family business film never let undeniably powerful story one retains capacity surprise initially seems obvious story vito corleone godfather powerful presence brando story play come moment realize story vitos son michael played wonderfully al pacino michael come film gripping start becomes even compelling character film evolved michael corleone michael meet sister wedding bear resemblance man see end performance pacino changing along character journey michael story unfolds quite ride well u privilege seeing brando pacino headliner wonderfully supported amazing cast includes like james caan robert duvall diane keaton al lettieri scratching surface many memorable character world coppola created character inhabit film unique look feel world godfather quite unlike often imitated never duplicated triumph every sense coppola perhaps biggest success making sympathize corleones know right start vito corleone man capable monstrous thing identify anyway one cannot help feel michael inexorably pulled family business everyone favorite godfather character favorite moment favorite line film become cultural touchstone continues discovered new generation seems film possible actually continues grow stature classic film stand test time godfather earned place honor history film true masterpiece

"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.

All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.

And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.

The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.

The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.

Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.

Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.",time time friend berate seeing film yet consider something movie buff duly sat saturday night curry director cut entertainment delight say there hour life im never going get back dont get wrong im big fan gangster movie ive studied early cagneyrobinson film seen important one scarface casino goodfellas even stayed awake upon time america godfather agonising slow meandering overlycomplicated lacking punch lashed bullet horse head certainly lacked dynamite watching godfather cinematic equivalent beach boy pet sound year impossible see earth considered groundbreakingly new exciting account coppolla making brave movie reintroducing genre stuck lavishing minute minutia one mafia family lavish thing say defence production design superb lacked nothing overall look film excellent budget must colossal pity plot dialogue didnt live promise cast huge impressive well twice pitiful legendary marlon brando couldnt fail disappoint poor man legend opinion far exceeded talent understand director begged brando come retirement although kind wish hed stayed incessant mumbling padded cheek peering dark corner scratching face turning volume way high becoming increasingly frustrated diane keaton played diane keatonannie hall real name trivia houndsas usual increasingly terrible haircut looked like wasnt sure movie looked like wanted go home relationship pacino totally lacked chemistry found return sicily widower highly unbelievable even pacinos thunderbolt relationship apollonia seemed contrived wooden know he meant hard man remained pokerfaced throughout movie lost feeling sympathy best part felt played james caan whose character labelled hot tempered father take interesting within corleone family course met predictably sticky end like lot better character found lot meandering plot predictable extent annoying diehard fan put show couldnt help something tell apollonia isnt going get car etc plot didnt really go anywhere seemed setting sequel every minute brandopacino inviting people take advantage offer couldnt refuse laughable caans none character slightest bit appealing outrageous behaviour tommy scorsese goodfellas example counterbalanced likable personality youre laughing spite pacinos protagonist scarface snorting copious amount cocaine waving gun around still care guy however monstrous he become pacino godfather cartoon badass like rest identikit baddie depth whatsoever remorse weakness humanity growth brando stumble death among tomato plant play grandson take mean coppolla showing u vito heart really little late coppolla may well brave reintroduce decidedly unfashionable genre conservative audience time might breath fresh air glamour pace subsequent better gangster fare put godfather shade however responsible film may genre future output
"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece.

"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.

The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order.""",godfather endless movie matter age discovered number time seen work lose ability fascination mystery problem talk limited amount praise expertise justifies either wonderful performance brando vito corleone evoked note modulation dialogue play cat three interview first sequence character defined tormented role pacino michael corleone war hero work require take place crime family impulsive character james caan counterpart reflective tom hagen play robert duvall accuracy smallest side corresponding name italian sollozzo tattaglia ribbon structure wise feel nearly three hour also exemplary could considered godfather organized around collective sequence religiousfamily marriage connie sunny sequence film sicilian intermediate achieved justly celebrated baptismslaughter disease death vito playing grandson among vine another anthology moment rest come await arrival violence unrelenting brutality shooting sonny foot house tribute coppola arthur penn bonnie clyde premiere michael restaurant riddled body stabbed dismembered strangled blunt kind feast degraded meat without mafia order
"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes.",movie directed wonderfully dialog good dont even know hour passed away al pacinos acting take movie whole another level good news godfather many amazing quality including fantastic performance unprecedented visuals engaging story bad news easily overall sprawling unfocused cant possibly give earns asset transcend whats basically mess overallalthough cinematography production design great really impressed darkly lit scene character feature set emerge pitchblackness everything rich deep shade burgundy brown orange amazingly nothing get lost scene

"This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.

On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.

The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.

As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.

Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made.",excellent movie great actor great scene great storyline one complaint lot material covered book movie without giving away much story many booksmore like part book godfather novel book ii focusing johnny fontaine exclusion part arent focus main character extremely close adaptation novel word word many sense epically near begging movie al pachino top movie steal show brando great also robert duvol tom hagen wonderfulthis one best movie ever made
"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".

If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.

Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.",rarely said film defined genre never true case godfather since release epic garnered ten academy award nomination named best picture gangster movie judged standard one unfair comparison may film jewish mobster jewish godfather chinese underworld oriental godfather take place contemporary time modern day godfather godfather guntoting mafia type would never garnered many accolade characteristic set film apart many predecessor successor ability weave oftendisparate layer story cohesive whole individual issue explored godfather strong enough form foundation movie however bolstered many complimentary theme given added resonance picture series miniclimaxes building devastating definitive conclusion rarely film tell many diverseyetinterconnected story strong performance solid directing tightlyplotted script contribute godfather success motion picture slapped together satiate appetite mass carefully painstakingly crafted every major character minor one molded distinct complex individual stereotype influence coppola film although certain one formed result

"Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.

Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.

Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.

When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.

"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.",take gangster film dip sepia tone wrap nino rota elegiac score add soap sentiment youve got godfather gone wind gangster film like gwtw godfather represents oldstyle hollywood filmmaking popular masterpiece goodfellas soprano make seem almost antiquated coppola direction attempt sweeping script character shallow predictable scaled epic film slow moving talky several character sequence feel dispensable film doesnt really deepen build excitement progress despite talk family member corleone family essentially stock character pacino shire cazales caan dont bond family patriarch commanding even likable figure would inspire love loyalty morgana king mama barely exists though netted oscar brandos largely immobile performance gimmicky really supporting role term screen time godfather story michael corleone film owned brilliant al pacino support caan keaton duvall pretty much onenote godfather acknowledged film classic became cultural touchstone inspired imitation parodiesit medium event box office phenomenon swept oscar brandos sending sasheen littlefeather refuse oscar added legend
"Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.

The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.

Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.",coppola near perfect masterpiece first class cast including james caan al pacino heavy weight marlon brando name much add hasnt already written frankly quintessential family mafia gangster film nostalgic feel captured distinguished cinematography gordon willis script honed costume location set add overall authentic experience brandos aged makeup incredible particularly apart insignificant choppy editing stock footage film near enough picture perfect timeless compulsive viewing reason godfather pedestal one greatest movie time offer refuse must see
"I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.

This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.",realize considered classic many people one alive saw pre nostalgic place still keep movie alive even modern era understand however one grows seeing movie like goodfellas movie last year seeing old time movie come across like joke acting overall structure laughably bad marlon brandos acting sooo hilariously bad marble cotton ball whatever shoved cheek ridiculously top voice bad hilarious movie classic time give break dont believe anyone modern era see movie actually enjoys pretend like everyone else theyre nothing fraud pretending cultured appreciating older cinema said appreciate time one must really suspend disbelief pretend worthy compared among movie last year
"I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando.

What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week.

"Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.

For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.

This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.

My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.",part reason godfather popular first viewing really seem something everyone thriller fascinating documentary mafia code half way minute tragic love story starter acting sensational people earth cannot identify marlon brandos whispering horse voice bulldog expression become probably famous performance hollywood history appearance al pacino starring role also highlight highlight course sound byte anyone scene masterpiece give famous quote away instantly recognisable heard movie split three part crime family consequence exile pacino reunion family character carry part plot set u sequel criticism film long winded virtually three hour long meticulous becomes hard digest sequel deep thoughtful try balance intellect action although certain extent succeeds wonder film would enjoyable experience less discussion plot detail thrill
"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever.",argued tom hank youve got mail godfather meet vital question come way life although reason never would eat orange every time someone take one citrus play film every chance perish maybe film begin without credit speech initial nine word patriotism immigration business honor belief hard reality blend believe america america made fortune fail final climax even high treasonthe michael corleone take belief family oneselfcan bad coppola lived limit set constant feeling going fired producer robert evans paramount giving truce would leave finish film believe beginning end day something far removed life mafia based bestseller pressure came juice talent essence inspired new hollywood marlon brando test hired refused young boy came interpretation al pacino john cazale made five film dying cancer five job diane keaton james caan robert de niro reinforcement second part neither music nino rota photography gordon willis second weakness love say offer could refuse think get bed enemy head horse reason many others godfather best movie ever
"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.

The Godfather (1972)

Director - Francis Ford Coppola

Cast - Marlon Brando & Al Pacino

Based on the Classic novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo, this movie is a resounding masterpiece in the field of arts & entertainment. So what makes it the greatest movie ever made. Is it the background score that stirs your soul every time it plays. Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character's journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche. Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to. Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone & furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone. I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts & Entertainment got their A game on & filled it with so much of class, passion, performance & excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema.",godfather director francis ford coppola cast marlon brando al pacino based classic novel godfather mario puzo movie resounding masterpiece field art entertainment make greatest movie ever made background score stir soul every time play detailed direction master coppola take character journey timeline also help unravel deep rooted mystery human psyche alluring cinematography gordon willis make every frame movie look like fascinating visual human eye ever stand witness masterclass acting given brando iconic vito corleone furthermore even better performance al pacino best role acting career also iconic character ever created celluloid michael corleone guess problem film creative genius field art entertainment got game filled much class passion performance excellence film option best film world cinema

"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.

Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.

Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.

The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.

It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.",best movie ever opinion see sayers get godfather rather ground breaking film time rather bold film still cinematic masterpiece everyone keep raving coppola best film apocalypse something extremely hard top compare two style directing different almost look like shot two different director godfather biggest issue poorly made editing unnecessarily lengthened scene totally unnecessary scene expect film something ive heard even director frustrated scene linger screen without evidence director really knew wanted end producer decided amp film material best thing film acting there way denying film show people think marlon brando one greatest actor history film showed u genius al pacino time since ive seen part remember liking better ive always thought vast improvement first one
"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.

There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.",thought book overdone corny read thought movie overacted bordered fantasy saw spent year major city police department occasion deal mob type nothing like portrayed film hollow shell men somehow know bravado sham good action scene picture find constant atmosphere universal admiration thuggery aimed juvenile patron

"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.

Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:

I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'",film open last saturday august japanese surrendered opening scene film camera slowly pull back face man corleones dark home office regally ruthlessly hold court carry crime family business daughter wedding reception held bright sunshiny outdoor veranda long island compound according corleones irishgerman overseer surrogate son tom hagen robert duvall part wedding sicilian refuse request daughter wedding day custom father bride grant favor promise petitioner supplicant pay homage seated front don desk undertaker named amerigo bonasera salvatore corsitto speaking heavy accent vito corleones wife godmother bonaseras daughter bonasera desperately pleads favor proper vengeful justice rather american justice threatened nearrape brutal beating suffered daughter raised american fashion nonitalian boyfriend friend two brute received court date suspended sentence believe america america made fortune raised daughter american fashion gave freedom taught never dishonor family found boyfriend italiantwo month ago took drive another boyfriend made drink whiskey tried take advantage resisted kept honor beat like animalshe light life beautiful girl never beautiful againii went police like good american two boy brought trial judge sentenced three year prison suspended sentence suspended sentence went free day stood courtroom like fool two bastard smiled said wife justice must go corleone

The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits.

"This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.

The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie.

"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...

Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed. And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid.

"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting.",francis ford coppola screen adaptation mario puzos novel godfather cinematic master piece thought provoking irony shroud film leaf audience astounded excellence work character dynamic go extensive amount growth throughout duration film use irony antithesis juxtaposition create complex story surface although movie complex layered difficult follow long want get experience recommend watching installment rather make movie easier follow keep attention span fresh lot violence overly gory tasteful film tarantino nature leave gun behind grab cannoli enjoy exemplary film full plot grade acting
"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.

The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema.

"I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again.

"I decided to give this movie a go after seeing it in the #2 spot in the IMDB top 250 list.

This movie establishes the characters well, and all of the acting in this movie seemed top notch, with even small character roles being portrayed convincingly throughout the film.

Unfortunately, a large portion of the film contained long scenes that caused me to rapidly lose attention or become sleepy. The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.

The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa.",decided give movie go seeing spot imdb top list movie establishes character well acting movie seemed top notch even small character role portrayed convincingly throughout film unfortunately large portion film contained long scene caused rapidly lose attention become sleepy excessive amount time eg first min wedding well set pace film instead lulling audience dozy stupor many viewer would tempted jump phone notable part movie part action happens tense encounter police chief scene boom gate emotional garden scene dongrandson noteworthy part film cast finally given chance flex talent unfortunately agree many low reviewer summary say movie overrated may great movie even movie less likely earn star review likely give three hour nap sofa
"The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him.",godfather great noir style gangster movie also tale immigrant came country last part depression poor family europe came land free find wealth controlled land baron banker well like parent vito corleone raise family never wanted life son realizing word lost sonny fredo sickly child much hope making michael different went college service ww never supposed world attempt father life make realize father son swears revenge salatso police captain protects story unravels great performance brando caan pacinoduvallwith incredible supporting cast abe vigodarichard castalano diane keaton talia shire perhaps best supporting cast john cazale fredo supposedly brightest bulb bunch turn good schemer want whats coming

Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome.

"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!",im gonna write another review great flawless godfather already lot pretty much everyone know perfect movie instead im gonna share year old guy view masterpiece thus ill highlight importance first thing first yes like blockbuster kind movie know type ive absolutely adored cinema brought past year ive seen many movie s unlike generation say fond especially happy exception said cant imagine big movie nd favorite time movie ive seen pacing incredible picture meant timeless sound captivating plot classic dont get started performance marlon brando greatest actor walked earth proved best maybe best performance time id seen streetcar waterfront could believe eye shame rating truly least even objective voting generation spends buck hour explosion every summer another useless moneymaker movie never know greatness hour epic true masterpiece

"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers.

The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that.

"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.

This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.

The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.

The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.

One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.

Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.",really liked godfather content movie think movie overrated back might greatest movie ever film talk rivalry italian mafia family living new york city main focus corleone family patriarch family got shot youngest son michael join family business vengeance acting definitely overrated marlon brando al pacino james caan delivered marvelous performance remembered forever score nino rota probably one famous one stuck inside head month one thing movie movie long boring scene stretched movie nearly three hour long accept last lotr movie interesting engaging overall great film exactly masterpiece rate film

This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).

With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.

It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.

"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a film that carries the weight of cinematic history. Its reputation precedes it, and expectations soar as high as the towering peaks of Mount Everest. But does it live up to the hype? Let's delve into the details.

The Slow Pace:
The film's deliberate pacing has been both its strength and its Achilles' heel. Some viewers might find it too leisurely, akin to savoring a fine Italian meal over several courses. Scenes unfold gradually, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the world of the Corleone family.

However, for those accustomed to fast-paced action, ""The Godfather"" can feel like a languid river winding through time. The tension builds incrementally, and patience is required to appreciate its nuances.

When you approach a classic like ""The Godfather,"" you carry with you the collective weight of critical acclaim, awards, and cultural impact. It's like stepping onto a grand stage where every note must be pitch-perfect.

Unfortunately, this burden can sometimes overshadow the experience. We anticipate fireworks at every turn, but instead, we get quiet conversations in dimly lit rooms. The film's brilliance lies in these subtleties, but they may not satisfy everyone.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic. His wheezy voice and deliberate movements convey a lifetime of power and cunning. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone brings depth to his transformation from reluctant heir to ruthless strategist.

The tension hangs thick in the air-the smell of cigars, the dimly lit offices, and the hushed conversations-all contribute to an atmosphere that envelops us.

Yet, this deliberate approach can alienate viewers seeking instant gratification.

""The Godfather"" strips away the glitz and glamour associated with mobster films. Instead, it reveals the raw underbelly-the power struggles, betrayals, and blood-soaked loyalties.

The mafia isn't romanticized; it's portrayed as a ruthless business where family bonds are both strength and vulnerability.

Over all, ""The Godfather"" is like a fine wine-one that requires patience to savor fully. If you're willing to embrace its measured pace and peer beyond the surface glamour, you'll find a masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment.

Note: While some may find it slow-paced, others consider it a methodical masterpiece. 🎥🍷",godfather directed francis ford coppola film carry weight cinematic history reputation precedes expectation soar high towering peak mount everest live hype let delve detail slow pace film deliberate pacing strength achilles heel viewer might find leisurely akin savoring fine italian meal several course scene unfold gradually allowing u immerse world corleone family however accustomed fastpaced action godfather feel like languid river winding time tension build incrementally patience required appreciate nuance approach classic like godfather carry collective weight critical acclaim award cultural impact like stepping onto grand stage every note must pitchperfect unfortunately burden sometimes overshadow experience anticipate firework every turn instead get quiet conversation dimly lit room film brilliance lie subtlety may satisfy everyone marlon brandos portrayal vito corleone iconic wheezy voice deliberate movement convey lifetime power cunning al pacino michael corleone brings depth transformation reluctant heir ruthless strategist tension hang thick airthe smell cigar dimly lit office hushed conversationsall contribute atmosphere envelops u yet deliberate approach alienate viewer seeking instant gratification godfather strip away glitz glamour associated mobster film instead reveals raw underbellythe power struggle betrayal bloodsoaked loyalty mafia isnt romanticized portrayed ruthless business family bond strength vulnerability godfather like fine wineone requires patience savor fully youre willing embrace measured pace peer beyond surface glamour youll find masterpiece transcends mere entertainment note may find slowpaced others consider methodical masterpiece

"The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.",puzo novel brought screen definitive tale mafia towering achievement coppola film released brando ideally cast title role basically supporting role story michael pacino excellent conveying transformation character geeky soldier tough mob bos caan duvall castellano head terrific supporting cast despite nearly threehour running time drag minute cinematography perfectly evokes period rota score one memorable film history
"Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.

With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.

In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.

The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.

Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.

The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor.",vito corleone mightiest mafia bos new york contact esteemed politician achieves everything get head change drug dealer asks join drug traffic vito decline offer ironically considers line business crime thereon drug dealer men assault vito nearly loses life son sonny michael thereupon start campaign vengeance drug dealer don new york high expectation began watch film due fact highest rated movie imdb regarded one best film alltime first half hour comparatively spectacular event godfather manages tie viewer conveying atmosphere well movie never becomes boring interaction mafioso language method amazingly enthralling also setting amongst others film take place sicily film music outstanding main character presented well mighty godfather morality take care family despite racketeering hand good boy family impelled dirty hand become unscrupulous ice cold gangster assault father francis ford coppola film becomes true masterpiece performance two leading actor marlon brando vito corleone al pacino michael corleone facial expression gesture unparalleled dont lay rest film prize series oscar golden globe thats absolutely merited everyone watch film least one time prestigious film amongst men popular high culticfactor
"The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.

This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.

The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.

I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"".

"The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.

Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.

A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.

Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.

"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.

A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.

Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.",godfather doesnt need introduction necessarily require review nevertheless im going go telling already know one great american film twentieth century landmark decade hollywood filmmaking francis ford coppola particularly productive releasing first two godfather film conversation perhaps magnum opus apocalypse week fortunate enough experience cinema screening godfather second viewing inflated respect coppola achievement initial viewing impressed film also hopelessly lost part literally dozen speaking role frequent allusion otherwise unseen character plot left stranded big sleep always manages suddenly however much became clear character motivation deception emotion gently drifted focus stunning complex cinema sort bold filmmaking put modern movie shame notable artistic observation regarding godfather coppola filmmaking style strictly traditional whereas new generation filmmaker like martin scorsese william friedkin introducing gritty new cinema aesthetic gordon willis cinematography graceful understated handsome predating excellent work woody allen notable example manhattan sprawling family saga godfather boast staggering ensemble cast emerging established actor well many unknown nevertheless give letterperfect performance scene violence typically abrupt effective much film runningtime closely concerned dialogue human interaction particularly among family member needless say quality talent enough make scene watchable astonishingly compelling every character smallest speaking part lot richly fleshedout personality making action development throughout film authentic interesting marlon brando along last tango paris deemed grand comeback give towering oscarwinning portrayal vito corleone aging head italian organisedcrime family endured decade corruption interfamily conflict seeing household disintegrate futile pursuit family honour vito finally understands final moment folly wasted life fateful mistake led undesirable lifestyle precursor year would explored greater depth robert deniro role godfather part ii central story however transformation youngest son michael al pacino course film effectively sell soul retain elusive family honour climactic sequence utilising eisenstein style montage fullest extent intercuts baptism michael nephew simultaneous assassination corleone family enemy scene also serf baptism sort michael symbolising irreversible initiation life crime final transaction soul
"The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.

It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.

"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.

Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.",continually fail understand godfather hailed greatest movie time ive seen twicea second time make sureand tell sat stupor bored mind im teenager raised mtv im absolutely devoted moviesive seen many classic american foreign get hand godfather rank alongside singin rain overrated film time singin rain least get intense dislike donald oconnor make dislike film godfather bland epic bunch moronic gangster marlon brando giving campy performance riddled repulsive violence give break fact movie beloved direct result nowadays got absurdly worse worse film every year created clueless filmmaker
"The Godfather is an iconic movie about a young man taking over the crime family, it's a beautifully executed film about depravity, suffering and desperation.

The pacing is quite thoughtful and despite the long runtime it never really feels dull. The actors bring their A-game here and the main characters are quite well written. Visually it looks very good for the time though some scenes are a bit stiff. The tension the writers are able to portray is masterful and the dialogue is meaningful.

Some scenes cut too quickly to each other and it can feel very disorienting, especially when it concerns a time jump. The movie is perhaps a little too long and could benefit from a few scenes being shortened.

Overall The Godfather is a classic for a reason it's a thought-provoking drama with excellent tension and twists. It's overrated for sure but that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece of the time.",godfather iconic movie young man taking crime family beautifully executed film depravity suffering desperation pacing quite thoughtful despite long runtime never really feel dull actor bring agame main character quite well written visually look good time though scene bit stiff tension writer able portray masterful dialogue meaningful scene cut quickly feel disorienting especially concern time jump movie perhaps little long could benefit scene shortened overall godfather classic reason thoughtprovoking drama excellent tension twist overrated sure doesnt stop masterpiece time

"I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.

The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.

Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.

I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center.

I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.

Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.

Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.

I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".

I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology.

"The Year was 1972. The Vietnam War still had 2 more years before it was finally over, Star Wars was probably being written by George Lucas while he was prepping American Graffiti, Watergate was on American peoples minds, Russel Crowe was 8 years old and as for me...........well, i was not even a Glitch in my mothers Womb. That was the Year when a movie came out that was something Special, a movie that we still talk about today and even some might call the greatest film of all time. That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments.

"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and holding an unforgettable place in cinema history, is a masterpiece. The film focuses on the Corleone family's involvement in the world of crime, while also exploring themes of family values, loyalty, and power.

The film stands out with a deliberate yet profoundly impactful pace. By delving into character development and the intricacies of relationships, it presents the audience with a rich and poignant narrative. Marlon Brando's unforgettable performance as Don Vito Corleone breathes life into the characters.

The theme of ""power"" is one of the central elements of the film. The complexity behind the Corleone family's criminal empire, the challenges of the pursuit of power, and ethical dilemmas prompt viewers to contemplate. Additionally, the family's loyalty and devotion form the deeply explored emotional dimension of the film.

Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, ""The Godfather"" boasts a highly intricate plot. This richness contributes to the film's captivating and immersive quality. The meticulously crafted atmosphere and attention to detail create an intense world, allowing viewers to intimately experience the underbelly of the criminal underworld and the characters' internal conflicts.

However, the film's deliberate pace might test the patience of some viewers. The in-depth character development and intricate web of relationships might not satisfy those expecting fast-paced action.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" remains a masterpiece, despite its deliberate pace, due to its intricate narrative and rich character depth. Addressing universal themes such as power, family values, and loyalty, it has secured a significant place in cinematic history.",godfather directed francis ford coppola holding unforgettable place cinema history masterpiece film focus corleone family involvement world crime also exploring theme family value loyalty power film stand deliberate yet profoundly impactful pace delving character development intricacy relationship present audience rich poignant narrative marlon brandos unforgettable performance vito corleone breathes life character theme power one central element film complexity behind corleone family criminal empire challenge pursuit power ethical dilemma prompt viewer contemplate additionally family loyalty devotion form deeply explored emotional dimension film adapted mario puzos novel godfather boast highly intricate plot richness contributes film captivating immersive quality meticulously crafted atmosphere attention detail create intense world allowing viewer intimately experience underbelly criminal underworld character internal conflict however film deliberate pace might test patience viewer indepth character development intricate web relationship might satisfy expecting fastpaced action conclusion godfather remains masterpiece despite deliberate pace due intricate narrative rich character depth addressing universal theme power family value loyalty secured significant place cinematic history
"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia.

It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both.

"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.

Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.

The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time.",godfather released golden age hollywood long regardless film managed recall era time taking advantage ever changing time film darker grittier film thirty forty melancholy starting become common movie definitely didnt forget root however popular film noir style evident film lighting dark subject matter often bleak theme theme movie indeed bleak fact people shot blown revenge acted upon inexperienced movie viewer might wonder point point violence hate wealth good total justification mayhem mafia may murderous revengeful value possibly even value normal law biding citizen marlon brando give breathtaking performance vito corleone man vicious harden yet learn care guy family enough eventually root every time get way al pacino also give great performance vitos son michael different vito many way learn early could care less family business yet know likely shoved eventually learn able control family develop lust power revenge cause fail altogether question like keep film interesting moving forward well orchestrated character also help plot along point seem unrealistic even make drastic choice important since character driven film thats one many strength seen great film multiple strength movie exception many crime film made film well one came sometimes weighed hollywood glamor one came often flash substance relentlessly violent reward end viewer godfather dodge weakness also avoids pretentious overblown one many thing make godfather best movie seventy possibly best time

Whether its the acting, the music, the cast, screenplay...everything is spot on and credit to Francis Ford Coppola for not only directing this but also choosing to stick with a new comer like Al Pacino where as the production wanted a household name, casting Brando and setting the story in New York despite being nearly fired on 3-4 occasions.

"Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an unforgettable film. Coppola's great direction, the strong acting of Brando, A. Pacino and J. Caan are the winning ingredients of the film. An immense Brando pours all his acting genius into his role, giving Vito Corleone the appearance of a melancholic, mysterious man who, despite his criminal past, is purely respectable and honorable. Only an actor like Brando could give a mafia boss such a profound and multifaceted personality, only he could, in just a few scenes, make a character immortal.

"Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?

""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.

Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)

This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.

So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart.""",godfather romanticize crime criminal yes take instance godfather name corleone translates lionhearted suggesting hero compared richard lionhearted legendary chivalrous hero crusade friend robin hood doubt author mario puzo director francis ford coppola made romantic idol corleones film gild mystery honor gallantry holy crusade corleones leader seemingly war survival vicious enemy would destroy gang care happens bunch evil criminal godfather much interesting fails show audience show film maker wrongly assume audience sophisticated enough infer kind lurid educational scene made great success earlier gangster film nitty gritty illustration inside working organized crime loan sharking extortion vice godfather part ignores subject matter everyday business crime favor end part story war gang control racket drama essentially without motivation movie simply interested showing u much dirty business reason war hero would seem much less chivalrous criminal enterprise shown depth real understanding length movie play revenge tragedy gallant protagonist could member great family whether criminal protecting cherished honor film maker deliberately sanitize criminal aspect corleone family apologist crime think one confidence game employed film maker also familiar among annals organized crime leader variation trick called bait switch expect portrait ruthless immoral criminal instead made believe essential moral rightness corleone condemns contemptible enemy kind criminal trade narcotic word lured theater promise true life depiction action bad guy film maker slyly pull fast one show u good guy instead persuaded ignore fact godfather extortionist pimp even worse asked believe extortion pimping bad especially practiced honorable guy like corleone whatever failing much decent trade narcotic jiggery pokery effective around time movie sequel came ivy league educated friend mine way brilliant career wall street bitterly denounced critic godfather making claim corleone entitled regarded great hero like president franklin delano roosevelt general douglas macarthur doctor albert schweitzer received similarly adulatory treatment film friend seen godfather convinced mafia leader might honorable heroic portrait movie presented feel need occasion remind public mafia even allegedly refuse get involved narcotic sale mafia mainly business vice feed weakness mass little people corruptible vulnerable appeal easy sex cheap thrill quick money quick fix problem little people pay vice life much afford pay end ruined greater glory mafia racket crime glorious petty mean easily committed anyone less courage daring average person easy understand film maker left movie would kind absurd call scuzzy dirtbag name lionheart
"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.

This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well.

"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.

I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.

This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.

Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",watching lot movie imdb top list somewhat agree movie placed watched movie shawshank redemption least five time awesome finally got godfather expected lot seeing would better shawshank redemption however could barely sit half godfather absolutely nothing happens yeah guy get shot people get angry wow anyway would grudgingly say acting pretty good good acting doesnt make movie worth seeing old movie guess overall quality cant great even aside movie still lack good plot maybe even importantly emotion shawshank redemption really made sympathize character movie made go sleep quickly boring wouldnt recommend movie anyone

I also liked the fact that this movie is not all about gunshots and stuff like this. It shows us the problems that the Corleone family has to deal with and I was just amazed by the plot.

Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s.

"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece.

"I truly wish all those who believe this film is boring and overrated can understand it one day.

Everything in The Godfather is executed to the utmost degree.

Characters- Each member of the family is very distinct. From the very serious Tom to wacky Clemenza to fiery Sonny to wise and calculated Vito to cold Michael, The Godfather has very colorful characters.

Cinematography- Gordon Willis, the main cinematographer of The Godfather does an excellent job portraying a gritty city, riddled with crime. There are beautiful shots of the urban landscape. My favorite in particular is the one with the Statue of Liberty, the black car and the grainy field.

Setting- The Godfather taking place over 10 years is perfect. Starting with the end of WW2, with Michael being a veteran and all and ending 10 years later, no longer being loyal to his country but to the family.

Writing- There's a reason it's up there with Chinatown and Casablanca as a film among the top three greatest American screenplays. The slow descent of madness is perfectly executed.

There are other Mafia families equally powerful to Don Vito's family. One guy Sollozzo, who wants to start his drug business under the protection of Godfather. But Don Vito who is a good mafia rejects this deal as drug business is against his principles.

"The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.

Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.

Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.

The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.

Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.

Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.

His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.

An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.",godfather soak u dry never hustle something deliberate journey time corleone entrusts rein power would made hourandfortyminutelong thriller unbecoming even length character relationship understand merely way exchange look dont speak inclined associate corleones family enjoy gang war opening celebrate wonderful wedding full old italian song dance love later watch await violence sitting kitchen table eating pasta cooked clemenza endowed nino rota immortal extraordinary music score consummate masterpiece entitled godfather title relevant wise vito corleone head family unruffled effectiveness also son michael hesitant college graduate beginning feeling shame criminal background firm living life upright citizen coppola follows michael ascent power within family top concurrent wearing away heart vito corleone even central character drama relaxed puppeteer central character really slowly come youngest smartest son michael absorbs spirit father standing reworking outdated custom godfather function family enterprise illustrated name existing outside following generation continue luck point family legal endeavor marlon brando play vito perceptive resilient model family man wise latter year fact character lead whereas al pacino michael lead unhurried physically ease one know reaction would great anger harassed face grooming given least effort needed good attractive look there look he awakened first groggy morning hour time always seems stuck within presence imprinted brooding nonchalant style smooth understated muster searing inner fire make tremendous character arc impactful amazing brandos performance always expertly offhand earned oscar voice physicality consciously lack precision incidental result man home power longer need prompt anyone remaining actor furnish one caseinpoint another superb instinctive casting macho tempestuous james caan pragmatic downtoearth robert duvall instance hardly act embody role quintessential crime drama extensive painstakingly thorough film nearly three hour genuinely isnt time go personal history distinctiveness character clemenza richard castellano hardened heavyset family lieutenant jack woltz john marley excellent face movie baron luca brasi faithful contract killer mccluskey sterling hayden corrupt cop rest coppola meet issue headon unassuming typecasting character appears story long enough say hello goodbye matter small better real enough assume vote really opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes u dynamic family authoritarianism guise old world ceremony coppola asserts style visual guise quintessential gordon willis reddishbrown tinted overexposed cinematography everything period furnishing men wearing black suit sitting dark boardroom parley particular prostitution gambling fashion isolated society issue stability integrity term advantage politician policeman merely intimidated trafficked esteem reliability legal tender influence emerges calmly keep quiet control territory successor santino caan role always cooking implicit rage incredibly eager inherit position brother michael sniveling pushover fredo played late john cazale duvall role tom hagen unemotional factual family lawyer allaround professional shrewd pragmatist embraced vito child brought woman much background scenery vitos wife scarcely speaks even appears sonny wife suffers silently shameless infidelity corleone daughter connie played talia shire often overlooked brother take notice unless protest disgusting husband beaten assault vitos life alters michael attitude come back help defend family wellbeing sonny take rash control making mess business laying everyone line laid incapacitated vito look michael bona fide defining moment make mark one film unforgettable scene ultimate virtuosity take upon hit small italian restaurant using gun left bathroom stall force banishment sicily solidifies determination return family status eminence

"I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichés. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them.",im fan goodfellas donnie brasco well soprano maybe didnt warm really care corleone family cant understand high mind excessive praise film receives even understand popularity character shallow onedimensional yet film take seriously treat gravity isnt shred irony humor nearly hour film didnt find numerous scene family business dealing compelling persuaded film attempt draw parallel organized crime business politics talia shire robert duvall morgana king brando caan pacino never felt like family rarely ever together godfather ever meet talk michael wife kaye brandos performance impressive stunt really supporting role old don manner speaking becomes tiresome film solemn pacing pacino film star excellent convincing transformation freshfaced poker face diane keaton kaye unbelievably naive talia shire connie carry melodramatic scene including fight husband redolent many scene marital discord morgana king mama corleone spout clichés though character guilty betrayal double crossing murder actually developed sympathy corleones victim notably tessio moe green

"The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.

Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.",godfather franis ford coppollas best work next apocalypse one best film ever seen show way life shown film released likely shocked much shocked acting among many thing highlight filmnoirgangsterepic including marlon brando recognizable performance ever man corleone also subtle work breakthrough star al pacino others like james caan robert duvall great bit part wonderful character actor like john marley sterling hayden corleone get wounded default various circumstance family least ailing health hand business ambivalent cunning son michael well done performance al pacino film go long watching time hardly notice every time one watch film get better noticing something small something wildly creative one didnt notice last time thanks get richer every time beautiful score terrific cinematography sublime directing writing coppolla puzo film belongs place film history world history well
"The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.

I give The Godfather a perfect:

"From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it.

"There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.

The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.

With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.",isnt gangster film bigger better godfather hard word go centre film family corleone family headed vito marlon brando aka godfather daughter wedding tell u need know corleones key individual small incredibly thought subplots running theme business personal matter never mix godfather based simplest foundation love thy family think act never betray vito attempt keep peace crime family thing go south vitos youngest son michael al pacino get involved michael innocence torn apart take control family business every view come new discovery piece puzzle missed last time round godfather labyrinth waiting deciphered brando sublime he able radiate warmth coercion smallest reaction set career james caan robert duvall whore brother dissimilar attitude best come pacino first part trilogy show potential godfather one intense gangster film youre ever likely see
"After seeing the rating of this movie, don't think that you're gonna have a good time.

A good example: ""12 Angry Men"", which is 5th in the IMDb Top 250: Even though it's a very old movie, you're gonna watch it with your eyes wide open, afraid of missing a single word of the dialogues.

This movie? You'll put it aside and go cook something while it is playing in the background.

Now, you gotta know these things before watching it:

1) It doesn't really tell anything. It has a story, but it doesn't start and doesn't end. It's just there and it's honestly pretty boring. It has no purpose, no meaning. It's not interesting.

2) You won't remember a single character a week after except the Godfather (Marlon Brando, he played great). All the other characters lack personality, motives, charisma, it feels almost like if they aren't existing. They are greyed out.

3) It has a very, very, very slow place. Now I know this doesn't necessarily make the movie bad, but in this case it just multiplies all the other cons.

This movie is extremely overrated.",seeing rating movie dont think youre gonna good time good example angry men th imdb top even though old movie youre gonna watch eye wide open afraid missing single word dialogue movie youll put aside go cook something playing background gotta know thing watching doesnt really tell anything story doesnt start doesnt end honestly pretty boring purpose meaning interesting wont remember single character week except godfather marlon brando played great character lack personality motif charisma feel almost like arent existing greyed slow place know doesnt necessarily make movie bad case multiplies con movie extremely overrated

"The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.

Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.

What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.

The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.

The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.

The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.

In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best.

"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.

Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.

I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.

With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.

Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once.

"The Godfather Trilogy was projected on one single day at the Paris cinematheque: 9 hours of film and 9 hours of pure delight!

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same

Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!

What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!

So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!",godfather trilogy projected one single day paris cinematheque hour film hour pure delight motivated see trilogy particular one first heartstruck movie thank father kid watched watched formatted ever music pride honor family confidence find resonance even though heart deeply corrupted evil pay price death dear one whats point getting rich powerful live alone read review last indepth analysis thematic background brando wonderful old look like late grandfather havent time spend time together sure take vito idealized root caught eye first movie story take place wwii christmas time projection dementia greed vito want son president way getting top denied help kill asked help exchange favor far street tug ransom people maybe best movie ever made see offer cant refuse
"I saw the movie some years back mainly due to the hype.. I liked it & would have given it 6/10 at that time..

Three years later I bought the book(accidentally).. Well just for the sake of buying something really wasn't going to read it anyway (so I thought)..

A few days later I read a few pages & started loving it.. I was hooked on to the book like a Harry Potter fan & couldn't put it down..

THEN..I watched the movie ... Then I knew why there was so much hype around the movie even after 30 years...

The movie just brought back the characters to life...

I loved it & thus the rating 9.6/10 However the movie is not as good as the book.... but I think it's as close a movie will ever get to the original.. Which by the way is a masterpiece..

The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..

All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)...

"Many men has called this the greatest movie ever made. I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power.

I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.

The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that ""wow"" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.

This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person)

It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.

If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like ""the departed"" and ""scarface"" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""Dances with Wolves"" or even my favorite gangster movie ""Goodfellas"".",many men called greatest movie ever made disagree though liked much hype movie interesting movie say lot world live men seek power seen read intimidation used people trying personally attack called movie terrible boring calling stupid many jumped wagon calling greatest movie ever made avoid attack similar pattern physically strong emotionally weak men like capone hitler came power movie significant world film history however give movie today standard less artistic entertaining original also feel much new original learn movie get wow feeling would much interest see one favorite gangster movie though certainly terrible boring however lack much think great movie moral point emotion surprise humor editing cinematography original thought special effect music score even actingthe tough guy role challenging play mentally ill person also appeal broad audience movie many woman child like great time compared today movie limited area greatness like movie like old gangster movie even tough guy movie like departed scarface want know hype recommend movie great movie genre reach emotional theatrical height movie like forrest gump lord ring dance wolf even favorite gangster movie goodfellas
"The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.

Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

"When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.

Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.

""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.

Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.

Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.

But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.

""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.",come naming greatest influential motion picture time francis ford coppola masterpiece godfather title practically guaranteed among many listed famed director stanley kubrick called godfather candidate best movie ever made without doubt best cast although familiar kubrick film taste say second regard absolutely correct based good hardtoputdown novel italian american novelist mario puzo film revolves around fictional sicilian crime family based new york family run wispyvoiced puffycheeked man named vito corleone marlon brando part moved away day violence favor peace prosperity without blood thing lecture topic friendship loyalty attempt made vitos life two son james caan al pacino adoptive son robert duvall take control dynasty fight keep alive unfolds repeat day gone world mafia exposed spellbound absorbed audience godfather nearly three hour length part due fact follows mario puzos novel almost exactly detailbydetail scenebyscene rare thing hollywood always seems happy alter reshape mold author vision big screen coppola film without doubt satisfy purist even privilege reading puzos fantastic book still enjoyable way spend three hour even length godfather never fails keep eye focused screen number one great character possibly greatest cast ever assembled single movie marlon brando great given really impressed audience still impress people performance supporting cast name al pacino robert duvall james caan icon status today nobody time al pacino particular give noteworthy performance garnered academy award nomination made producer initially wanted ban role feel like biggest idiot face planet pacino undoubtedly ironic character film first see he even much sliver mafiatype image he passive he quiet shy clean record war hero assume family role defend father slowly turn image predecessor time film end pacino exact opposite first saw course cant leave diane keaton pacinos love interest watch change eye james caan fierytempered brother robert duvall family consiligere one favorite al lettieri villainous steelyeyed virgil sollozzo fit exact image pictured character reading novel second fantastic element whole realm story take place world mafia none tired old element shall say detective trying uncover mafia take civilian become victim organized crime family method successfully connect understand motivation character outside world law otherwise simply lie background outside world meant little mafia thus mean little u well course godfather glorify mafia yes identify sometimes feel character savage world never justify director francis ford coppola try give u horrifying violence delivers noted commentary film coppola worked hard pyrotechnic crew make shooting killing godfather look real opposed making obvious simulation us blood much point becomes top enough make convincing disgusting godfather enormous hit first released garnered academy award win included best picture year broke box office record would topped jaw released three year later al pacino james caan robert duvall secured nomination best supporting actor category surprisingly none also spawned two successful sequel one feel actually superior original francis ford coppola worked robert harris restore famous trilogy give pristine print always wanted audience see among film lawrence arabia vertigo spartacus godfather certainly film deserves beautiful restoration may linger collective mind generation come
"...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.

The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.

""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.

So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

"he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur.""

Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""

Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""

The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.

At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.

Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes – especially in the Don's home office – with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.

The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).

With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.",godfather gangster movie space odyssey science fiction like stanley kubrick francis ford coppola reenergized degree reinvented basic hollywood pulp fiction actionentertainment genre using vehicle high artistic ambition postnew wave film auteur within narrower focus th century american civilization opposed kubrick philosophical speculation human evolution coppola shape story corleone mafia family epicsatiric vision american business government justice moral decline godfather brilliantly constructed opening sequence wedding corleones daughter establishes don character nature organization role family sicilian tradition world character son three natural one adopted also establishes relationship don world legitimate society instance film opening word bonasera petitioner wedding favor whose voice dark screen first asserts american dream believe america america made fortune turn disillusioned contradiction justice must go corleone numerous subsequent line dialog establish literal metaphorical connection criminal underworld social institution memorable one include father different powerful man man power like president senatornow union gambling theyre best thing narcotic thing future dont get piece action risk everything mean ten year personal sonny strictly business famously im gonna make offer cant refuse film title refers two godfather original corleone youngest son ultimate successor michael marlon brandos performance corleone awarded best actor academy award balance don subtly counterpointed function beloved grandfatherly patriarch fearsome brutal crime bos yet michael character centrally significantly affected film plot played brilliance equaling brandos unknown al pacino principal protagonist wedding michael centrality signaled don frantic call wheres michael taking picture without michael world war ii hero still decorated uniform michael meanwhile busy differentiating family girl friend future second wife kay diane keaton luca brasi held gun band leader head relates father assured either signature brain would release thats family kay michael initial disinterest mafia activity reinforced adoring father envisions senator corleone governor corleone successor role reserved hotheaded eldest son sonny james caan course event conspire suck michael keep sucking right godfather iii assassination attempt father michael coolly murderous response car bomb meant kill first wife sicilian beauty apollonia aptly named god sun light riddled body brother sonny inevitably morally darkened michael emerges end film one outdoes father guile ruthlessness whose final brutal deceitful act godfather seal doom macbethlike villainous tragic hero shot mainly location various new york city locale godfather span ten year post world war ii period multitude prop costume pop culture artifact arranged film art director warren clyner production designer dean tavoularis lend rich sense historical authenticity film mise en scene moreover film lighting brilliant cinematographer gordon prince darkness willis contributes greatly film realism thematic symbolism compare instance use extremely dark shadowy color desaturated interior scene especially don home office brightly lit vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene sundrenched romanticized sicilian landscape godfather edited classic hollywood invisible style subordinating technique need narrative visual continuity film expertly edited nonetheless particular one might note stunning use multiple parallel editing occurs one film last scene assassination crime family head elaborately planned coincide michael participation baptism sister connies child likewise godfather soundtrack memorable combination diegetic period music merry little christmas lush operatic original score composed one greatest film music composer nino rota frequent fellini collaborator godfather even ambitious sequel coppola pushed classic gangster film direction high art released moralistic grip hay code arose large part response romanticizing criminal found early example gangster genre scarface little cesar public enemy code regulate degree nature sexual violent imagery film also specifically required criminal portrayed morally repulsive social deviant plot involving resolved implicit explicit lesson crime pay fortunately american popular culture godfather radically rewrote rulebook paved way generationsworth gangster masterpiece ranging scarface remake pulp fiction soprano

An offer you can't refuse ...

The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever

Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.

Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.

Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:

'The best gangster film since The Godfather'

Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.

Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.

In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.",much enjoy film intrigued throughout still dont like see gain repetitive status greatest movie time feel movie relevant context glamourised lifestyle crooked dealing italianamerican mafia gain grand title however admittedly unlike goodfellas instance godfather glamourised much im thankful coppolla turning time tedious book hour long gripping tale enjoy book lucky coppolla man got hand turned godfather section mindbendingly gripping scene ever film genre incredibly overrated godfather certainly stand head shoulder rest however feel genre forever hold back greatest movie time

"What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said? The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling. I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film.

The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it. However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C) It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater.

Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime. If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.

Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.,definitely overrated movie ever bad pretty slow ive tried failed make many time always fall asleep perfect example classic thats surviving nostalgia im sure time revolutionary reminds older folk talk favorite athlete past sure time great let honest cant keep modern time im year old reference case come sounding like child
"One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It felt like a Lifetime movie except for the angry wife seeking revenge it is angry men seeking revenge. The movie starts out with no back story to introduce the characters, who they are, where they are in life and a why to it all while introducing their goals or life plans. As the story progresses the characters do not grow as humans and develop more depth, to the contrary they go in the opposite direction they become less mature and even less human. They lose any depth they had and seem to be motivated entirely by revenge and greed. It is not an antihero story where the main character's motives and means is questionable but ultimately relatable and you feel if you were in the position you might or at least would be tempted to do the same, it's more of a childish jerk story where they seem to be very childish meaning impulsive, over reacting and not thought out well in terms of long term consequences. It is an incredibly slow moving movie and I just finished the movie not a full 15 minutes ago and if you were to show me a picture of a character and ask me who it is, I don't think I could tell you because the writing is so sloppy that you don't build a connection with the characters that make you care about what happens to them, as I was watching the film I was hoping for murders because it would have added some action to an incredibly slow film and because it would mean the end was nearing.",one boring movie ever watched felt like lifetime movie except angry wife seeking revenge angry men seeking revenge movie start back story introduce character life introducing goal life plan story progress character grow human develop depth contrary go opposite direction become less mature even less human lose depth seem motivated entirely revenge greed antihero story main character motif mean questionable ultimately relatable feel position might least would tempted childish jerk story seem childish meaning impulsive reacting thought well term long term consequence incredibly slow moving movie finished movie full minute ago show picture character ask dont think could tell writing sloppy dont build connection character make care happens watching film hoping murder would added action incredibly slow film would mean end nearing
"Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.

""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).

""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.

""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.

""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...

"I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.

Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.

A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.

Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.

The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.

About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

"Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10",coppola crime saga sweeping scale yet intimate scope focusing much family dynamic mafia machination impactful godfather honestly feel epic despite fact relatively key event quite contained considering span nearly threehours effect hard put finger certainly tangible especially retrospect really feel though youve witnessed journey beginning empire least transitioning period within way film achieved actually fair learn anything outrightly illegitimate actually transpiring though even treated casually really feel like family business thats real strength picture little relies needless exposition convey character world refreshing get truly inside perspective sometimes unseemly event without ever bombarded morality instead trusted make mind several situation shaded grey piece little long sometimes meander several explosive sequence characterdriven moment add equal measure excellent experience overall defined gangster genre regarded classic good reason

"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠

'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.

Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.

The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.

'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.

Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.

For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.",rating masterpiece godfather masterpiece perfect gangster movie film without flaw blunder cliche pull writing review feel like know completely heart seen million time classic gangster epic bible cinephiles worthy picture without exaggeration best kind adapted mario puzos bestselling mafia saga godfather serious dramatic masterpiece directed francis ford coppola genuinely topnotch film depicts blood sweat drama corleone mafia family film long running time hour minute leisurely apotheosis corleone family marvellously build rich pattern relationship meticulously detailing ritual enclosed group tone film laudatory romantic extraordinary chiaroscuro cinematography completely steal heart godfather contains famous unforgettable scene opening wedding celebration severed horse head left enemy bed coldblooded killing happening simultaneously baby baptism however favourite scene movie one wherein michael corleones new bride dy car bombblast coppola superbly created film brilliantly chose actor know fate film would without marlon brando al pacino marlon brando outstanding cottonstuffed cheek almost inaudible whisper perfectly define style reigning head mafia presence brings energy screen definitely brandos best ever performance oscar infamously refused yes man made offer others couldnt refuse refused movie industry heftiest honour michael corleone al pacino less interesting father michael kindhearted truthful knowing father never wanted deal family business participate criminal quarrel al pacino played character less brilliantly marlon brando pacino showed destruction transformation character uninitiated affair family young war hero new corleone family possessing iron foresight wisdom dignity coldbloodedness film powerful conveying code loyalty love masculine honour feminine subservience enterprise corporate selfinterests crimeridden america addition brilliant acting excellent production film wonderful music score composer nino rota excellent melody long become classic
"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.

I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.

Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.",saw first time teenager pretty bored time seeing thing like scarecrow deliverance like interested seeing juvenile nonsense ive seen recently twice admire movie like hold interest think good fail understand imdb troll think greatest thing since invention lightbulb reason ive rated lower normally would cause youve gone overboard admiration pacino winning oscar huge injustice make entire movie worthwhile doesnt even talk james caan miscast brando terrific didnt win dont think earth would ceased existing pacinos movie someone must agreed wme since second one
"Finally took the time to give myself a real treat and watch this film again after about 20 years as I remembered it as a supremely good film. I have watched many movies from all over the world during the years and have developed a keen eye for good film making, so wanted to review one of the ""greats"".

After having watched it again, I have no choice but to face the fact that this film is indeed very poor film making and I have to admit that I feel embarrassed that I once actually considered this a good film!

The biggest gripe I have with this film is the unbelievably poor and unconvincing acting, devoid of any emotional depth whatsoever. Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about.

Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity. A staggering waste of talent.

To top it off, the storyline is thin and highly predictable, simply an unforgivable waste of potential.

The organized crime genre of films have always fascinated me and continue to do so. With so many truly great films in this genre, don't waste your time on this one. The Godfather is one of the very worst.",finally took time give real treat watch film year remembered supremely good film watched many movie world year developed keen eye good film making wanted review one great watched choice face fact film indeed poor film making admit feel embarrassed actually considered good film biggest gripe film unbelievably poor unconvincing acting devoid emotional depth whatsoever everybody sterile noone worth caring even least bit secondly almost every opportunity character dynamic development missed character developed michael corleones even character changing one extreme instant transition whatsoever result character mere moronic caricature point absurdity staggering waste talent top storyline thin highly predictable simply unforgivable waste potential organized crime genre film always fascinated continue many truly great film genre dont waste time one godfather one worst
"Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.

Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.

What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.

The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.

Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.

Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.

"Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.

It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.

This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.

But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.

The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.

There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.

""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.

One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.

The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.

Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.

In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.

Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.

"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.

It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.

Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)

What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****",star ratingunmissablevery goodokayyou could go meal insteadavoid cost epic tale vito marlon brando head patriarch corleone crime familywhen rival family try muscle patchthey offer usual resistancebut brutally gunned streeta vicious attempt lifeit fall sonsmichael al pacinothe youngesta vietnam vet returned home active servicefredo john cazele reservedpronetomistakes brother scillio james caan hotheadedviolent sonto settle score amicably mettle funny six day ago reviewing film ranked bottom list yet today im reviewing film rank right top yetindeedthis truly epic film everyone would like call film connoisseur owes see brando sadly passed away last yearif extroverted private lifehe undoubtedly best remembered leading role heredespite staggeringly short amount screentime actually occupiespacino really launched career hereand amazing look back see young freshfaced lookedin supporting rolesthe film also undoubtedly helped make big name caan robert duvall family lawyereven directorfrancis ford coppolaprobably never made anything matched especially consider chunk crp shooting later career found notable film actually sweepingpowerful score play scene majesty truly compelling stick mind youve seen itbut thatit film truly rich flowing texture depththat manages flow vitality charactersi short attention spanlike lot people mtv generationso film might find hard settle watch without fidgeting around lotbut anyone see would unable deny iswellreally filmmaking abouttruly masterfulfulfilleddynamic stuff put lot rubbish get spewed today shame
"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.

Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.

The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)",beginning movie always set tone go movie watching understand influenced tv show soprano back first scene involves godfather character talk people wedding day daughter tradition way filmed lit exceptional tone set one setting also get movie respect fear power get achieved manipulation convincing one way buyout lie thing godfather always tell child lawyer family matter movie hold test time might seen movie violence movie get violent doesnt hold back performance awesome cant wait listen audio commentary mr coppola supposed controversial ill see rewatching movie reminded good also much miss soprano one known little fact movie marlon brando stuffing cheek make look movie differently still take nothing away course exceptional every sense even dont agree way family function shouldnt agree course saying
"Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.",overrated maybe little bit really wellmade film feature wonderful performance pacing film drive crazy godfather isnt afraid take time let u get know character iconic movie though doubt
"The Godfather (1972)

**** (out of 4)

Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece adapted from Mario Puzo's novel about crime lord Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his attempt to keep his family from going in the wrong direction. Everything imaginable has already been said about this movie so there's not too many reasons to go back through it. Having recently watched the movie theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly. People know about the studio not wanting Brando and Al Pacino but can you imagine what would have happened had neither one been here? I've never felt this was anywhere near Brando's greatest performance and in fact I might not even place it in the top ten. That's not saying anything against his work here but it speaks for how great he was. I think the most impressive thing was seeing how well he could play someone elderly. Just think that he followed this up with LAST TANGO IN Paris and it just shows what all he could do. With Pacino it has been said that the studio didn't like the rushes they were seeing involving some of his early stuff like at the wedding. Watching these scenes it's easy to see why they'd be nervous but just check out the sequence when his character takes on the responsibility of going to the restaurant. It's really like Pacino the legend is born in this scene and that brilliant scene is like us seeing what was to follow in his career.

Not only is there Brando and Pacino but also Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Abe Vigoda turning in masterful performances. Another thing that really sticks out is how brave Coppola was for letting the story takes its time. There are many, many slow moments here where we get dialogue scenes that get dragged out. Everyone mentions the wedding sequence but this is a perfect example of where the slowness is such a benefit as it really gets you on the inside of understanding how this family works. Coppola allowing the film to takes its time was a dangerous move but it really pays off because there's not another film like this. A lot of future movies tried to copy the style and this certainly slow, building drama but none of them were as successful. Nino Rota's music is simply irresistible and the opening cords as the movie opens are just chilling. The cinematography is some of the most amazing you're ever going to see and the lighting here is among the greatest ever. Especially effective are the scenes inside the Don's office and how the light was used.

THE GODFATHER isn't going to get my vote as the greatest movie of all time, of the decade or even the greatest gangster picture. With that said, there's no question that this is still a essential part of American film history and with so much talent involved it's just amazing to watch it today and admire what all they were able to accomplish.",godfather francis ford coppola epic masterpiece adapted mario puzos novel crime lord corleone marlon brando attempt keep family going wrong direction everything imaginable already said movie there many reason go back recently watched movie theatrical part paramounts rerelease must say knowing film story closely allowed sit back enjoy coppola put screen really struck many reason film shouldnt worked yet everything came together perfectly people know studio wanting brando al pacino imagine would happened neither one ive never felt anywhere near brandos greatest performance fact might even place top ten thats saying anything work speaks great think impressive thing seeing well could play someone elderly think followed last tango paris show could pacino said studio didnt like rush seeing involving early stuff like wedding watching scene easy see theyd nervous check sequence character take responsibility going restaurant really like pacino legend born scene brilliant scene like u seeing follow career brando pacino also robert duvall james caan diane keaton talia shire john cazale abe vigoda turning masterful performance another thing really stick brave coppola letting story take time many many slow moment get dialogue scene get dragged everyone mention wedding sequence perfect example slowness benefit really get inside understanding family work coppola allowing film take time dangerous move really pay there another film like lot future movie tried copy style certainly slow building drama none successful nino rota music simply irresistible opening cord movie open chilling cinematography amazing youre ever going see lighting among greatest ever especially effective scene inside don office light used godfather isnt going get vote greatest movie time decade even greatest gangster picture said there question still essential part american film history much talent involved amazing watch today admire able accomplish

"The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn't be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others.

"This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.

I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.

It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question.

"This may be regarded as the best film of the entire history of cinema, it is almost perfect in all respects, photography, script, editing, all with great technique and art at the same time, I find it significant errors.

All the performances are great, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, etc.. All individually and collectively make a masterpiece of interpretation.

The script is perhaps most shocking, the story of a reluctant to participate in the murky family business man, and the gradual change of their convictions through circumstances, recreates a picture of that violent era of U.S. history.

Photographic techniques are also impressive, not only for the beauty of the image, but also for the handling of camera you are carrying the story gets very intense feelings in the viewer.

I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.

Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it.

"In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).

Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).

Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).

Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).

Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.",contrast part loosely structured sometimes less climactic also seems improvised thanks enormous effort put detailed cinematography camerawork lends repeated viewing one example vito shot there poster grocery store announcing fight jake lamotta thus foreshadowing assassination attempt probably interesting light dark contrast outer ordinary world inner godfather world even two world meet one shot still strictly separated showing two room way watch one world end shot eg kay seen one room men another door shuts effective use mirror reflection door separating world window showing perspective backtoback shot shot object obscures picture see many modern filmmaker get idea karwai example coppola watched antonioni well scene building space shown create alienating effect loneliness combined tension hospital scene character disappear static shot room seen signify emptiness fight connie carlo especially end scene well edited composed even improved scene two year later
"The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever. Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia. James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens. A big accident. Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director. He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here. the acting was wonderful from everybody.

"Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made.",many viewed film consider one best film ever best film ever made performance marlon brando legendary iconic plot development character development far head film pleasure seeing opinion stand film perhaps understated unappreciated film performance everal pacino played believe believable powerful performance film history complexity michael corleone slow uncontrolled spiral dark side power influencenever seen complete developed performance see idealistic young man forced life rejected become ruthless feared crime figure timeall maintaining realism going top much like tony montana character pacino played scarface displaying power intimidation minimal effort threatening physical attribute pacino able let u viewer delve deep soul tortured young man see birth power hungry perverse monster carry like wolf sheep clothing crime stellar performance awarded academy award first two film trilogy allows u see al pacino reach pinnacle acting closing might considered best overall character performance film series truly appreciated powerful performance godfather part iii pacinos performance godfather opinion single best performance film history godfather greatest american film ever made
"The Godfather - Crime, Underworld Movie Cast - Al Pacino, Marlon Brando

It is the highest-rated movie of all time. I found it realistic about underworld life. I have never seen any movie adapted from a very linear simple story but picturized with an awesome screenplay. The acting of every male character in this movie was top notch though all the female characters were more than dull. I liked the patience and planning of a godfather and how he deals with his enemies. There were some heavy dialogues delivered perfectly.

However, I did not like the story that much. It is more than good according to the year of its publication. But still, there is nothing to learn from this movie. This movie is enjoyable at the same time boring. The story is also predictable and there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie. I will recommend this movie as maybe this movie does not reside with my taste but others may like it so much. Finally, I found it overhyped and overrated.

"I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons.

1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.

2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot.

Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film.

Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.

"The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants.

"The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.

It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.

"A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.

The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.

Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.

I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.

Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.

Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.

Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.

We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.

The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.

(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)

Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""

Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".

The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.

Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around.

"Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.",chance may heard film maybe havent anyway let cut chase godfather running three hour boast least four set piece edge seat director take care familiarising u corleone family also staff associate really engages viewer also witness transformation certain michael corleone element tragedy film sow seed future perpetration revenge ultimate message took away man capacity cause absolute carnage clearly already know suppose little harm remind fact term acting superlative everyone putting credible performance given director incredible pressure make success fantastic feat still hold today definitive mob movie however let put one side reserve special credit nino rota carmine coppola created quite possibly best recognisable soundtrack movie history dont already recommend buy godfather trilogy album song album dont send shiver spine reduce tear poignancy composition strongly believe film would without soundtrack crucial overall structure

"Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration.

I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...

I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them).

Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it. Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying.

I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.

My rating for the film is 8 of 10.",without doubt quality movie good plot good acting good directing mysterious however considered many people best ever made origin mystery need exploration think technically film pretty well made although without flaw knew great nino rota melody long saw movie amazed wasted film intermezzo horribly performed suggest two reason high rating american adore mafia film appeal desire simple man imagine deadly hero would explain also touch much film innovative time appeared manner dont understand perhaps cinematographic trick revolutionary time used every film since would explain see godfather ii impressed much go first mentioned reason romanticism vengeance protection family think courageous show bare face mafia country adored deadly businessmen godfather ii really horrifying cannot comment suggestion number case reason historical significance rating film
"Some things are just meant to be perfect, flawless and well, godly. The Godfather , by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is . The way every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling compliments the other in this unforgettable film causes one to wonder ( really) if such a feat can be repeated, ever .

I always have the highest regard for the script before anything associated with films , therefore I'd like to talk about Godfather's screenplay first .

Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name The Godfather is all about a man's relationship with his family and his responsibilties towards it, that can cause him to abandon his own dreams and ambitions. That this setup is showcased by one of the most powerful mafia families in 1940s New York makes it all the more interesting .

The simple plot being that the head of the Corleone crime family is aging and other crime bosses want him out of the way seems rather straightforward. Enter Don Vito Corleone's youngest son Michael aka 'the innocent college boy' - as his elder brother and apparent heir Sonny Corleone likes to call him - along with a girl. He sums up his life and all that he expects from it in future in one line - ""This is my family Kay , not me. "" Quite clearly the kid wants nothing to do with his crime family or its power. But this family thrives on crime and inevitably becomes a victim as well. After Vito refuses to deal with a narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he sets off a chain of events that alters his family and business structure forever. Even a man who has experienced all that life could offer fails to see what's coming and expresses his surprise later on.

A heartbreaking and mind numbing tale of how a powerful crime family comes to terms with all that it feeds on and how the same entities almost destroy the family was , is and will remain unforgettable .

The number of memorable scenes and dialouges is mind boggling. The scene where the Don delivers his famous line "" I'm gonna make him ......."" is enough to express the immeasurable power that the man possesses . And the one where a proud Hollywood producer awakes to find on his bed a ....... , or the restaurant where Michael ......... , or when Sonny pays the price for being hotheaded , and when the Don talks to his son , or when Michael does what he is destined to do, The Godfather overflows with great scenes.

The music and cinematography by Nino Rota and Gordon Willis respectively contribute greatly to the film's overall impact .

The Godfather can never be mentioned without naming Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the same breath. The level of acting is just ""Oh My Gosh"" . While Brando is great and very believable as Vito Corleone , Al Pacino is and will always remain the one and only choice for Michael Corleone . It is said that Brando developed the mannerisms of Vito himself and if so , then he absolutely deserves his Oscar . Al Pacino transforms Michael from the ideal son to the guy he eventually becomes making sure that one is overwhelmed by the portrayal .

Not once have i mentioned in my tribute ( i ain't that great enough to review The Godfather) that The Godfather is a person, because he isn't and as the Hindi film ' Sarkar' , influenced heavily by The Godfather , says "" The Godfather is not a man , but an idea."" Just that this idea created history.

Note: As much as i don't want to mention it , i do really feel that there is one sequence in the film that required the editor's attention. But nonetheless , it only appears as such in repeated viewings and not the first one . So set aside your coke and popcorn because you're not just watching any other flick , you are watching the greatest of them all and after the conclusion you'll realise that the coke and popcorn are as they were when the words The Godfather appeared on the screen some three hours ago .",thing meant perfect flawless well godly godfather francis ford coppola mario puzo way every aspect filmmaking storytelling compliment unforgettable film cause one wonder really feat repeated ever always highest regard script anything associated film therefore id like talk godfather screenplay first adapted mario puzos novel name godfather man relationship family responsibilties towards cause abandon dream ambition setup showcased one powerful mafia family new york make interesting simple plot head corleone crime family aging crime boss want way seems rather straightforward enter vito corleones youngest son michael aka innocent college boy elder brother apparent heir sonny corleone like call along girl sum life expects future one line family kay quite clearly kid want nothing crime family power family thrives crime inevitably becomes victim well vito refuse deal narcotic kingpin named virgil sollozo set chain event alters family business structure forever even man experienced life could offer fails see whats coming express surprise later heartbreaking mind numbing tale powerful crime family come term feed entity almost destroy family remain unforgettable number memorable scene dialouges mind boggling scene delivers famous line im gonna make enough express immeasurable power man possesses one proud hollywood producer awakes find bed restaurant michael sonny pay price hotheaded talk son michael destined godfather overflow great scene music cinematography nino rota gordon willis respectively contribute greatly film overall impact godfather never mentioned without naming marlon brando al pacino breath level acting oh gosh brando great believable vito corleone al pacino always remain one choice michael corleone said brando developed mannerism vito absolutely deserves oscar al pacino transforms michael ideal son guy eventually becomes making sure one overwhelmed portrayal mentioned tribute aint great enough review godfather godfather person isnt hindi film sarkar influenced heavily godfather say godfather man idea idea created history note much dont want mention really feel one sequence film required editor attention nonetheless appears repeated viewing first one set aside coke popcorn youre watching flick watching greatest conclusion youll realise coke popcorn word godfather appeared screen three hour ago

Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie.

"Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.

However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able.

Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one.

The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.",italian film quite often come sort controversy large part fact italian immigrant given undeserved reputation inherently violent universally tied sort organized crime mass medium one main reason francis ford coppola godfather instigated fierce opposition controversy released coppola insisted film italian involved organized crime instead metaphorical representation american government personally dont believe one going watch film like overlook exactly see make connection film american government however take away overall accomplishment film make genius godfather lie coppola obvious directing skill well author mario puzos skill storyteller film tell story five tremendously powerful crime family war one another one seems quite sure committed crime instigated war make interesting investigation subplot marlon brandos performance vito corleone one best history one major accomplishment film whole able take man really despicable person make endearing character really care leader crime family made antagonist film twist thing around like one thing really make watchable aside making corleone likeable character also made tremendously respectable personally noticed watched godfather recently going watching james bond film james bond supposed one tasteful refined highclass figure action film brandos corleone effortlessly make even sean connerys bond look like spice girl story godfather complex involved enough taken three long film tied together brilliantly film end vito corleones son michael taking leadership position scene doesnt leave room sequel demand one film end michael corleone father office addressed two father assistant corleone title attributed father point film would unsatisfactory end film way without continuing story done two year later yet another best picture winner godfather landmark film history incredible story astronomical performance expert direction picture perfect cinematography film literally packed memorable famous scene performance everyone involved spectacular even three hour godfather never get boring slow stunningly intense ride beginning end
"This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (""What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?""). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando's movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever.",greatest movie ever made give interesting view mafia teach many valuable lesson idea good example first scene meeting bonasera ever deserve disrespect first time saw movie godfather definitely made smarter prepared independence teenager would recommend child seen movie watch right away full box set seen numerous time third disappointing though dry acting repetitive plot many awkward moment sofia coppola al pacino also glad first two movie much violence although fair amount thompson gun habit quoting brando play character delivers powerful meaningful line movie seen seen brandos movie streetcar missouri break freshman line unique unconventionally spoken sometimes make laugh true shame brando die nottooold age although good health time although many people sure claim fame brando accomplished always remember greatest actor ever
"So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of ""Deliverance"" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their ""labor""? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them.

"We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film.",know wonderful movie saw original release netherlands weekday afternoon perhaps people theaterwhen michael killed cop gangster walked right intermission could hear everyone theater gasping relief pentup breath godfather one great goof ever shown scene sonny beat carlo street front carlos bookmaking operation there shot sonny swinging roundhouse right left carlos face hear impact carlos face nice foley work carlos head jerked right impact quite persuasive except one thing camera positioned directly side fight line zero degree angle clearly see sonny hand miss carlos face least inch phantom punch get kick every time watch film

It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA",movie call movie greatest union artist starting director finishing composer stepping actor even movie made true sicilian smell like sicily coppola present nonsicilian spectator gloomy charm arid land mobmovie also film element united among love hatred violence friendship betrayal beauty first scene great salvatore corsitto amerigo bonasera last scene film keep even reclutantest spectator vice emotion evocative image sicily corleones speech made movie maybe important work cinematographic sphere timesan icon conclusion short review say one thing believe america
"Hollywood has some strange politics. Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops. Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves. And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow). Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.

All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs. I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power. I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""

I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here. And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film). Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.

I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world). But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.",hollywood strange politics note civil war movie tend favor confederacy union crime movie almost always favor crook cop yet real life even cop annoy u time time think prefer murderer thief even though confederacy romantic air attached glad union sane one amongst u anyhow somehow movie dont quite reflect actually think often end rooting protagonist would hate real life buildup lead doubtless controversial statement cant really warm godfather bunch scuzzballs admire movie cant love relate way except maybe allegory corrupting influence power cant relate lotr either way dont think either film deserves title bestest picture ever actually think godfather part ii much better concerned family relationship human element boring gangstervsgangster conflict predominate theory people confuse first two godfather film mind combining best element kind uberpicture doesnt actually exist people thing star war mistakenly remembering yoda luke father element classic first film famous godfather scene sequel get brando mumbling incoherently performance everyone make fun prefer donnie brasco character development richer even bronx tale powerful antigangster message meticulously recreates specific time neighborhood opposed film creates gangster fantasy world generally speaking ill take straight drama people arent hit men day
"Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!

Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't. By the time that it had ended, I was actually mad that I had wasted over two hours of my life watching it.

"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.",francis ford coppola godfather often voted amongst best film time watching today surprising conservative feel thats necessarily bad thing though undoubtedly piece filmmaking highest class also slow stately epic one could imagine made today quite form contrast scorceses goodfellas example show clearly direction filmmaking evolved hand fair godfather one must note much influenced gangster film succeeded perhaps making seem orthodox time release even story influenced real life mafia course there something conservative idea gangster story appeal idea tradition respect even need plot mean tale must inevitably focus period traditional code breaking need honesty must expose extent sham anyway godfather thing ultimately behind superficial subject matter story personal transformation al pacinos cleancut college kid true successor mafioso father played marlon brando fact arguably brandos last great complete cinematic performance well pacinos first undoubtedly added movie iconic status overall cant quite agree best movie ever sweep tale people lacking certain core humanity therefore lack emotional intensity favourite film still mighty thing worthy place cinematic canon

"Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.

But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.

The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.

The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.

It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on.",best movie category brandos acting magnitude best actor hollywood world theater suspect brandos brilliance unmatched anyone suspect example pacino superb still brando head shoulder pacino love brandos acting simply grab take anywhere movie want good movie good actor whole cast plot dialog scene last least director coppola near perfect thank god bringing talent hollywood brando coppola al pacino good brandos brilliance color fade away bit supporting actor robert duval also superb actor even cold bloody killing movie brings warmth family friendship loyalty coolheadedness audience making movie much gripping weight firstclass movie apparent starting first scene movie lasted throughout movie coppola know grab audience move plot movie true master hard compare coppola lucas wonderful director different class movie believe coppola better bring depth intricate emotion audience luca make memorable director even pas
"This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's ""five families"". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.

If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century.

"When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time.

"Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.

But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.

I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.

Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.

Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.

A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.",although high regard godfather gutsy crime melodrama would place film time place cinema history still go gone wind opinion brilliant piece work gorgeously photographed extremely well crafted throughout everyone cast perfectly suited role read mario puzo novel though actor hand picked role uniform precision highest ranking among performance marlon brando although needed caption feature catch mumbled word al pacino practically carry main part story earnest strong portrayal favorite son james caan hotheaded sonny diane keaton romantic interest kay pacino others standout work particularly richard costellano clemenza rumor detail reflect story behind frank sinatra desperate quest role maggio eternity apparently quite true crooning son need save fading singing career eager get serious role war film right italian persona learn sweetheart also object lust studio head spent million turning studio star risk losing property marries crooner sound familiar think ava gardner frank sinatra even sinatra kim novak harry cohn lecherous producer many detail true dont know like think author mario puzo invented aside aspect story culminates famous bloody comeuppance uncooperative producer plenty gripping sequence know something bad happen various injustice within crime family hook tie sequence together maintains suspense right final touching scene brilliant piece workbut still top favorite movie list wellstructured crime story man really knew write genreand man francis ford coppola really knew direct sort crime melodrama meticulously detailed realistically set

"Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries.",let start high praise regular sentence spoken movie motionpicture discus yes element extremely ambivalent context acting directing formal aspect exceptional achievement cannot think many others claim polished dialogue yet believable actor nevertheless aspect presenting familytragedy within mafiaclan least consumed mind switched coppola doesnt bother present obvious critical point view present member corleoneclan businessmen react surroundings way necessary protect family dont bother kill dozen people contrast loving father coldblooded head clan attracts many people brandos performance lifelike one hand yet manages mute questionable trait character would paint vito criminal whole said still movie polarize audience least due growing influence mafia like structure many poor country
"The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own. But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone.

"A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow.

"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen.

You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family.

The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.

To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another.

Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.

This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.

But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.

"In my personal opinion the godfather is an amazing movie that everyone should at least once as this is a timeless classic. The godfather has a lot of good elements and storytelling that is a very good watch. My one problem with the movie is how it is rated among the community. The godfather is commonly seen among the community as the greatest movie of all time, which in my opinion is not true. Although the godfather is a movie that everyone and there grandma has watched and enjoyed, including myself I don't think it should be marked down in history as the greatest movie of all time. Even movie that have come out i the past year have been on the same level, for example oppenheimer was a really good movie that was on the same level as the godfather.",personal opinion godfather amazing movie everyone least timeless classic godfather lot good element storytelling good watch one problem movie rated among community godfather commonly seen among community greatest movie time opinion true although godfather movie everyone grandma watched enjoyed including dont think marked history greatest movie time even movie come past year level example oppenheimer really good movie level godfather

"After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored. The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has. It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie. You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era. I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point!

"This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.

To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans.",probable best known mafia movie open post war new york centred corleone crime family particular tell vito corleone aging patriarch son michael hope succeed outside business time change organised crime believe future lie supply illegal narcotic something vito belief lead destruction authority wont turn blind eye like illicit gambling isnt long attempt made life michael pulled business seek revenge soon mob war triggered nobody truly safe call film sprawling might considered compliment meant one almost three hour shown ten year life one family high low story see michael transform man want man circumstance force isnt story glorifies mafia show men honour little day told safety assured day killed cast great marlon brando impressing oft imitated performance vito al pacino really fine job michael character change believably event affect rest cast includes james caan robert duvall sterling hayden diane keaton also great director francis ford coppola great job bringing story screen helped fine soundtrack nino rota overall id say must see fill fan
"I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn't enjoy. It probably wasn't the films' fault; it's just I'm used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films' quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather.

First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot.

In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It's the best start to a trilogy that I've ever seen!",time writing review movie watched made didnt enjoy probably wasnt film fault im used movie realistic cgi effect hd quality current actor nonetheless often found film quality grainy bear effect cheap appreciate like every film watched godfather first film made film quality superb also though didnt recognise actor knew talented even one essential story example man first scene coming godfather help emotion seemed real perfectly delivered line single lengthly shot conclusion movie still hold generation even like generally dislike old movie best start trilogy ive ever seen
"I must admit it wasn't until the second time I saw this film I realised just how flawless it really is.

However, what really struck me the second time was just how psychologically deep the movie really is, particularly in respect to the number of symbolic moments used throughout.

For instance, note the turning points in the film following Michaels visit to the hospital. Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette. He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.

Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw. Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business. He is calm and calculated in his plotting, and even physically resembles his father (swollen jawed).

"The movie is based on Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and tells a story of an organized crime family that has moved to America to create a fortune and gather the ultimate respect of the surrounding world.

I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected.",im voting commenting film bring pedestal invite everyone nothing italian mafia principal best film ever never entertaining film displayed rather ridiculous acting gross piece defamation perpetrated italian nothing violence gore even sex screen appropriate ludicrous consensus readership reached must corrected
"Check out a copy of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" from the library, or just buy the book (because you will want to anyway). Lots of people have commented on things they liked or didn't like in the script, not realizing that they are taken straight from Puzo's masterpiece. As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie. Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't ""hooked"" by the second or third page I would be amazed.

One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there's no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail). It's a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry. If it sounds like I'm reviewing the book more than the movie, it's probably because it's a long time since I've seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it's a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject. If you're a fan of the film, please grab the book as soon as you can and prepare to be transported. You won't be able to put it down, and your respect and liking for the film can only grow afterward.",check copy mario puzos godfather library buy book want anyway lot people commented thing liked didnt like script realizing taken straight puzos masterpiece almost always book better movie please favor pick copy somewhere arent hooked second third page would amazed one advantage book go much richer vivid detail film lot material book used subsequent godfather movie well there way single movie could ever capture much detail delightful utterly satisfying tapestry sound like im reviewing book movie probably long time since ive seen film reread book often work literary genius far finest work fiction ever written subject youre fan film please grab book soon prepare transported wont able put respect liking film grow afterward
"The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance!

The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the ""family business"". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical!

Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance ""low-key"". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a cliché ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!

Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire!

Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" and ""It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business"". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!

The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone!

"Whether you're an admirer of the genre or not, Mafia films have no better ally than The Godfather in defining what you expect from such a tragic and dramatic subject. This masterpiece doesn't just tell the story of killings and score-settling, it instils in its viewers values and ways of life that are benevolent and just a few steps away from the reasonable and respectable. As well as mixing several generations of absolutely titanic actors, the story behind the madness engendered by the thirst for power and money shows us that without love, family and friends, man will never be happy or fulfilled.

"Title: A Timeless Masterpiece - The Godfather

""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a cinematic gem that continues to stand the test of time. This iconic film not only redefined the crime genre but also set a new standard for storytelling and character development in the world of cinema.

The story revolves around the Corleone family, led by the enigmatic patriarch, Vito Corleone, portrayed brilliantly by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance is nothing short of legendary, as he effortlessly embodies the complex character of the mafia boss with a sense of authority and vulnerability that is unparalleled.

Al Pacino, in one of his career-defining roles, plays Michael Corleone, the youngest son who becomes entangled in the family's criminal empire. Watching his transformation from an innocent young man to a ruthless and calculating mobster is both captivating and chilling.

The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all deliver exceptional performances that add depth and authenticity to the narrative. The chemistry and dynamics among the characters are palpable, making the audience emotionally invested in their fates.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of perfection, creating an atmosphere that immerses viewers in the world of organized crime. The film's cinematography, with its evocative lighting and meticulous attention to detail, adds to the overall ambiance of tension and power struggles.

The Godfather's screenplay, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, is a masterclass in storytelling. It explores themes of family, loyalty, power, and corruption in a way that transcends its genre. The dialogue is iconic, and many lines from the film have become part of cinematic history.

Nino Rota's hauntingly beautiful score enhances the film's emotional impact, creating a sense of melancholy that lingers long after the credits roll.

In summary, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic treasure that has left an indelible mark on the film industry. It's a must-see for anyone who appreciates storytelling at its finest, masterful performances, and a gripping narrative that explores the depths of human nature.

"What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.

The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far.

Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family.",could said godfather legacy mafia crime family drama begin end line dialogue forever embedded american culture film discourse pacino brando dinero keaton caan whole cast fit bill impeccable conviction moral theme picture profound impact unlike preceding film empathizes traditionally antagonistic side society show varying dimension men steal rob murder reason personal selfindulgence believe life greatest benefit family take far film point narrow view motivation accomplice organized crime godfather enlightened film going public motivation mafia crime crime family doesnt defend merely observes chosen inherit ethic life crime family

"Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times.

"Without doubt, The Godfather is an excellent movie. The acting, script, mood, music, cinematography and an indefinable haunting quality, all make for one of the finest movies ever made.

However, I believe that the Godfather 2 is an even greater film. In fact, I consider it to be the best film I have ever seen. The last poignant moment of the movie with Michael Corleone in reflective mood, is in my opinion, one of the classic scenes in cinematic history. That one scene has always remained with me and I always associate it with this movie. I was pleased to see that this scene was also included in the most memorable moments in movie history at a recent Academy Awards ceremony.",without doubt godfather excellent movie acting script mood music cinematography indefinable haunting quality make one finest movie ever made however believe godfather even greater film fact consider best film ever seen last poignant moment movie michael corleone reflective mood opinion one classic scene cinematic history one scene always remained always associate movie pleased see scene also included memorable moment movie history recent academy award ceremony

"Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.

One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).

"Considered to be one of the best movies ever made, and I just finished watching it. This mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

For this movie, I decided not to write a full review as everyone knows how good the Godfather is. It has been an inspiration for all movies that came out after it. The cinematography is amazing, the plot is very grasping, the acting is phenomenal, the script is very well written, the plot twist are so shocking , the three hours run time passes by so quickly, and I could keep going on and on however I would like you to go watch that movie and experience it on your own. You don't have to be a fan of gangster movies to likes this, so you just need to go watch it for yourself as soon as possible and enjoy this masterpiece.

Score:9/10.",considered one best movie ever made finished watching mob drama based mario puzos novel name focus powerful italianamerican crime family vito corleone marlon brando don youngest son michael al pacino reluctantly join mafia becomes involved inevitable cycle violence betrayal although michael try maintain normal relationship wife kay diane keaton drawn deeper family business movie decided write full review everyone know good godfather inspiration movie came cinematography amazing plot grasping acting phenomenal script well written plot twist shocking three hour run time pass quickly could keep going however would like go watch movie experience dont fan gangster movie like need go watch soon possible enjoy masterpiece score
"There is only one movie, one movie that stands out in my mind when I think cinema. It Is...The Godfather. Its The Movie you can watch many times and still find something new you didin't notice your previous viewings. Its the movie where you can learn more about the characters every moment of the film. Its the movie that shows the true 1940's mafia. It is the definition of a movie.

Whether its the astonishing script, the incredible cast, and the amazing acting, you'll find something you'll like in this movie. Even if you hated this movie and disposes it, you can always say 1 thing you liked about it, at least 1 thing. As for the acting, Marlon Brando does one of the most memorable performances in the history of film-making. He plays the role of Vito Corleone, the head of one of the five families in New York City. He has 3 influential and historical actors as his son's. Michael being Al Pacino's part, plays his son, a young boy who just returned from world war II, not wanting anything to do with the family. Second, being the infamous James Caan, playing the hot headed Sonny, wanting to take over the family business when vito passes. Then There is Fredo, the poor, dimwitted, fredo, played by John Cazale.

Along with the cast is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son into the family, with irish blood at heart. Diane Keaton also does a fantastic job as a young woman dating Michael, not knowing what to expect.

The Movie provides something everyone will enjoy, if its the violence you like, you have a lot of it. If its intriguing storyline, bada bing...you have it. Or if you just want to see a nice cast, and one of the best movies ever made....You have it. There is no doubt that this movie will remain in your head after you see it, and its spawned many fans from all over the world. Its a tearjerker, a noir, a love story, and a movie about the mafia. As I have said before, It is the definition of a Movie.

"This movie was amazing. I've always wanted to watch it and I thought it wasn't my kind of movie at first since I'm more of a romance or thriller kind of person, but I was so wrong. It catches your attention from the beginning till the end. It surprised me, made me smile and also made me feel sad. The performances made by all the actors were amazing, the cinematography was outstanding as well but most importantly the writing, pacing and music were all magnificent, clever and carefully studied to make this movie stand out. I am italian so maybe this is a reason I enjoyed it even more, especially in the parts in which they talked italian, though I'm not from Sicily so sometimes I didn't get the dialect.. finally, this movie made me fall in love with Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's acting skills. It gives you everything and relaxes you while keeping you entertained, so that 3 hours will easily go by. Thank you!

"I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream.",saw movie father recommendation dramatical movie first perfect revenge movie gangster saw movie felt part widely two theme movie one american dream one many life mafia last son colione michael doesnt want join father business got hurt mafia gangster family came danger couldnt help assist finally realized destiny family fate became leader family good father cruelty better father finally became best godfather mafia lost old shape michael father vito show american dream reality movie dy grows many vegetable wanted wanted live normally became gangster son death michael victory family fighting movie continues darkness society bad side american dream

"Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.

The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie ""Avatar"" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.

I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now.

Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: ""Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other.

I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a ""mere"" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat ""harsh marker,"" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it.

On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life.",due restriction point voting system forced settle rating however prefer accurate score would star movie undoubtable classic ive noticed lot star review rather ignorant time rather obnoxious understandable doesnt live expectation dont even think movie option star rating anyone give lower rating really reviewing movie admit idea film idea popular would really live standard set many sycophantic fan seemed almost impossible already disappointed movie avatar visually course predictable time tiresome plot godfather hand much unpredictable storyline yet nothing happens huge shock time seemingly arbitrary event eventually collate cohesive part movie despite pushing hour mark constantly entertained hanging every word almost every action hold importance feeling something happen constant justified dont want reveal much movie shall attempt keep review vague place stop regard storyline even storyline fails inspire least sort appreciation five word command respect al pacino marlon brando give film level cool control power affect viewer many way maybe even reestablishes idea acting powerful emotion casually used air nonchalance grace emotion usually overplayed overacted movie actor flaunt talent carelessly film get masterclass acting two master screen acting every character pitched perfectly every character balance personality contrastingly complimentary towards lot good say movie explain gave mere firstly must admit dont believe idea thing perfect movie viewed somewhat harsh marker thus would never get full aspect film believe either superfluous underdeveloped basically put bit could maybe replaced extra character storyline development however personal issue would stress second highest rating ever given honest mind constantly changing score may actually future wish raise final note say truly one greatest film ever made would urge anyone reading watch film dont like shame probably film carry rest life

"progression of the movie follows the development of the following linear, logical sequenced story lines – Don Corleone is shot; Michael seeks retaliation by shooting Sollozzo and McClusky; The mafia family wars begin with a parallel story of Michael taking refuge in Italy; Don Corleone holds a peace summit between the families; Michael returns to America and becomes the new family Don upon his father's death. This is a standard ""cause and effect"" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along.",progression movie follows development following linear logical sequenced story line corleone shot michael seek retaliation shooting sollozzo mcclusky mafia family war begin parallel story michael taking refuge italy corleone hold peace summit family michael return america becomes new family upon father death standard cause effect progression scene logically leading next character differing goal clashing obtaining help character resolve conflict meet ultimate goal result character individual action well group interaction help move movie along
"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.

Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.

Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.

The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" or ""I'm a superstitious man!"". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.

The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in ""The Godfather: Part III""). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.

Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that.",movie extraordinary performance amazing direction incredible screenplay excellent soundtrack good great perfection every way first saw movie year old couldnt stand love patient watch movie observe every detail make unforgettable vito corleonebrando aging head corleone mafia family youngest son michaelpacino returned wwii time see wedding connie corleone tania shire michael sister carlo rizzirusso michael family involved mafia michael want live normal life drug dealer virgil sollozzolettieri looking mafia family offer protection exchange profit drug money approach corleone much advice don lawyer tom hagenduvall morally use drug turn offer please sollozzo shot hit men barely survives lead son michael begin violent mob war sollozzo tear corleone family apart everybody say movie get everything right true movie follows narrative rhythm impeccable never slows much thats whole movie slow tense scene like scene michael changing father room hospital even funny one michael sicily talking man girl met guy find shes daughter done excellency screenplay one best ever made develops character well almost everyone learning something story course give u memorable quote like classic im gonna make offer cant refuse im superstitious man soundtrack nino rota brilliant notice right first scene acting equally impressing even pacino dont usually blow mind like everyone say bad actor he excellent prefer contained calm performance impressed lot he cold look smart make turn believable intelligent brando give one best performance world ever seen considering movie released convinced sick old man pacino didnt well godfather part iii observe scene hagen tell sonny youll see mean saying one best time verdict lot people including say best movie ever made probably good reason say

"Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame.

"I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.

I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.

I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.

"The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.

Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast.",story disjointed acting terrible especially corleone sound like he got stick as film long wedding scene almost perpetual make ask get im shocked honest awful awful movie dont say lot movie since tend appreciate trying convey embarrassment go overrated movie time book there good acting performance movie memorable line excitement nothing im genuinely disgusted movie high accolade crap absolute crap brandos portrayal corleone got go one worst acting performance ive ever seen well accent us difficult understand scene he shot assassination attempt laughable dramatizes whole thing general acting performance portrayal corleone supposed feared crime lord contrived doesnt look believable im honestly shocked someone rated one best actor ever lived perform badly first film ive seen brando think unfair judge ability actor based poor performance expectation definitely lowered watch another movie see part cast
"The Godfather(1972) helped resurrect a low budget genre known as the gangster genre and turned it into a major film genre for the next two decades. Many people found a new way in speaking to each other by watching this film. In fact many members of organized crime in the USA began to pattern themselves right after the characters in the film. The gangster genre would become one of the most popular genres to come out of Hollywood since the end of Film Noir in 1958.

The film deals more with the joys and sorrows of an mafia family then with what they do for a living. You can identify with many characters from the film because many people also go through almost similar problems in life. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo contribute to give some excellent story telling visually. Marlon Brando gives a very good performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone.

There are many memorable moments in this film. One, the Wedding scene at the beginning of the movie. Two, the Sollozzo-McCluskey murder sequence. Finally, the death of Vito Corleone.

The Godfather's success would spawn many classic gangster flicks including Mean Streets(1973), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Once Upon a Time in America(1984), Goodfellas(1990), and Donnie Brasco(1997). Also influences filmmakers ranging from Martin Scorsese to Abel Ferrara and John Woo to Takeshi Kitano. Sergio Leone was at one point offered to direct The Godfather(1972) but turned it down. I believe that The Godfather(1972) would be just as good if in the hands of a genius like Sergio Leone.

Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the youngest son, Michael. James Caan gives the best performance of the film despite his role as a supporting actor. Frank Sinatara was considered for the role of Johnny the singer but didn't get it because the role was too close to home for the famed singer.

"People around me and IMDB ratings were saying that this movie is one of the best Hollywood movies in history. Despite all the things I've heard, I put off watching the movie for years. I watched hundreds of crime movies and TV series until I watched this movie. I finally watched the movie 50 years after its making. And I can say that the movie is a bit old for today. Because we have watched many productions like this and we are used to many of the details in the movie from different movies and TV series. Of course, this is not the fault of this film, but all that we are familiar with makes the film simple for today's cinema. I don't know how accurate it is to compare the movie with today's movies and evaluate it accordingly. But as today's audience, I can say that the film does not meet some demands.

"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as one of the greatest films ever made. What sets The Godfather apart is its meticulous storytelling and rich character development. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic, exuding a calm yet menacing presence that captures the essence of a powerful mafia don. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael Corleone into a ruthless leader is nothing short of brilliant, showcasing a complex and tragic character arc. Every scene is meticulously crafted, every line of dialogue carries weight, and every performance is memorable. The film's pacing, structure, and attention to detail make it a masterclass in filmmaking.

In conclusion, this movie is more than just a crime drama; it is an epic tale of family, power, and the dark consequences of ambition.

The cinematography is also great, an outstanding job from the creators.

"After all the hype people have given this movie and the fact it won Best Picture confuses me.

Most of it was just people sitting around talking. There were some good actiony scenes but they are few and far between, aside from Sonny's sister flipping her lid and smashing up the house, followed by the famous tollbooth scene a few minutes later.

Speaking of the house-smashing scene, it's meant to be dramatic but I burst out laughing, but that's just my morbid sense of humor.

Maybe I'm just not ""getting it"" and my head is up where the sun doesn't shine, but this movie was just...... kinda boring for me.",hype people given movie fact best picture confuses people sitting around talking good actiony scene far aside sonny sister flipping lid smashing house followed famous tollbooth scene minute later speaking housesmashing scene meant dramatic burst laughing thats morbid sense humor maybe im getting head sun doesnt shine movie kinda boring
"This movie for good reason is regarded along with its sequel (which I think is a better film) as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. The mark it has left on society, especially the male psyche can never be underestimated or for that matter fully gauged. All actors turn in career defining performances and the overall ""feel"" of the movie is such that you feel for characters that in reality you would have every right to loathe.

"This film captivates audiences by immersing them in an underworld that exists right under our noses. Coppola skillfully places us in the midst of a society created by and for criminals, where cold-blooded murderers and seemingly honorable men coexist. The film delves into the Corleone family, led by Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando. Don Vito, while occupying a unique position on the edge of this world, struggles to reconcile his moral principles with the reality of his surroundings. One particularly memorable scene takes place during his daughter's wedding, where his associate, Luca Brasi, rehearses a speech to be delivered to the Don. This scene showcases a humorous and endearing interaction between the two characters, evoking unexpected sympathy for these mobsters. It is worth noting that Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi, was an actual former mob hit-man, adding an extra layer of authenticity to his performance.",film captivates audience immersing underworld exists right nose coppola skillfully place u midst society created criminal coldblooded murderer seemingly honorable men coexist film delf corleone family led vito corleone portrayed marlon brando vito occupying unique position edge world struggle reconcile moral principle reality surroundings one particularly memorable scene take place daughter wedding associate luca brasi rehearses speech delivered scene showcase humorous endearing interaction two character evoking unexpected sympathy mobster worth noting lenny montana played luca brasi actual former mob hitman adding extra layer authenticity performance

"I was interested in one of the most highly reviewed movies of all time and I was not super disappointed but also not super impressed.

Most of the characters are good even though I think there are way too many and the movie should have focused on fewer but more extensively. The acting of the main characters was great but there were many performances on the side which almost made me laugh (at scenes which should not be funny). The cinematography is good. Overall I would say it is a fine movie but I will probably not watch it again soon. Though I liked the ending which pulled all of the stories together.

I feel like many people only remember: I'll make him an offer he can't refuse; and think it is the most iconic thing in a movie that ever happened.",interested one highly reviewed movie time super disappointed also super impressed character good even though think way many movie focused fewer extensively acting main character great many performance side almost made laugh scene funny cinematography good overall would say fine movie probably watch soon though liked ending pulled story together feel like many people remember ill make offer cant refuse think iconic thing movie ever happened

"Francis Ford Coppola manages to execute one of the finest pieces of American cinema with the first of his three part saga, The Godfather.

"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather isn't just a film it's an experience, a masterpiece of storytelling that elevates the crime genre into Shakespearean tragedy. Following the Corleone family's rise and struggle to maintain power, the film is both intimate and epic, anchored by Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformative arc as Michael.

The screenplay is razor-sharp, blending family loyalty, power struggles, and moral decay with poetic precision. Every frame feels deliberate, with Gordon Willis's moody cinematography setting a tone that's both elegant and foreboding. The haunting score by Nino Rota is the final cherry on top, cementing The Godfather as a cultural phenomenon.

It's not just a gangster movie it's a masterclass in filmmaking, with characters and quotes that have seeped into pop culture like an offer none of us could ever refuse.

This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a ""famiglia"" with that kind of activities. This movie is the ""standard"" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts.

"Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze!

The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the ""family business"". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-...

But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't ""doing anything"" for me. The entire notion of ""honor"" and ""chivalry"" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth.

The acting is insanely high quality and all of the actors cooperate to create one of the best choral performance of all time. Marlon Brandon is simply amazing, really beyond. The way in which he modulates his voice for the whole duration of the movie and his mouth position gives to the character such a specific personality which could be enough to make the movie itself. Al Pacino, who fought so hard for this part, is simply perfect for the role of the son. It's just incredible the depth and the courage with which he carries his performance for the whole duration of the movie, especially the way he shifts his believes. Remarkable how he works on the evolution of the character. Not to mention the sweat and amazingly talented Diane Keaton, who is just perfect for her role as well mannered girlfriend and later wife of Al Pacino. I couldn't recommend it more.

There is no movie quite like The Godfather. It was the movie that gave me a true respect for film and motivated me to seek out something else over those few family friendly flicks I'd see twice a year at the theater. Now I watch nearly a hundred every year and yet I've never found anything quite like this masterpiece. It's the type you can watch over and over again and somehow find new things that make you respect the film even more.

"OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it.

To make it short, it was boring, WAY to long for the amount of real action (and I don't mean Micheal bay action, I mean something like a traceable storyline that doesn't introduce new names and character every time something really happens (and thats not often the case) so that in the end, you don't even know who's who and what is really happening. I don't like a film where you don't know who is doing the action you see, especially if some of the main characters are so similar that you can't distinguish them in some scenes. Also, the film is too long. Take the first set for example, the wedding (or was it a wedding?). If you count all the minutes you see some macaroni's dancing without sense or entertaining the viewer, I think it's around 5 to 10mins. If you look at that you know why the movie is around 3 hours long. Coming to the characters, I didn't have any emotional relationship to them after 3 hours of nearly non-stop conversation. I didn't really care when they died, first because in most cases, I didn't know who was killed in the scene most times and second, because I had no emotions for them. (Let's take that scene near the end, where all the people get killed, like 5 or 6 in three different locations. I didn't even recognize one of them, the whole scene didn't make sense for me. Why would they shoot a women with their child in the bed, especially if the viewer doesn't know who (the f**k) she is??? Not really a pro for a so-called ""masterpiece"") The only two pros I have are the acting and the music. I have to say I'm not a pro in commenting acting in films (watched Catwoman and didn't have a clue why Halle Berry became the golden raspberry for their acting after learning all that stuff with the walking like a cat, martial arts etc.). But I have to say what I've seen in this film is the most natural acting possible. None of the scenes looks contrived, the ""we are all family"" part came very good. Also the soundtrack is really worth recognizing.

To sum it up:

Acting: 10/10 Storyline: 4/10 (really disappointing) Action: 3/10 (even more disappointing) Lenght: 2/10 Soundtrack: 8/10

Overall: Around 4-5/10, I'll give it 4 because it's overrated.

"Now I love movies in general, but somehow the so-called masterpiece ""The Godfather"" from 1972 has not appealed to me enough to sit through the darkly-lit, three-hour running time. However, I hear great things about ""The Offer"" which is about the making of ""The Godfather,"" so I decide to invest ten minutes of my time to see what this series is about. It is indeed a well-made show, with a good story, and I end up watching all episodes. So now in 2023 I just have to watch ""The Godfather."" I can see why this movie would be considered a classic for its time. It has interesting, brooding shots, cast with powerhouse actors, some not yet famous at the time but have since become huge celebrities in their own right. I do have issues with the movie's slow pace, some campy acting from supporting actors, like a couple of mafia sidekicks and the father of the bride in Sicily, awkward fade transitions between scenes, and some rather disjointed turn of events. But all of that is forgiven now that I have discovered the gem that is Al Pacino. I have watched a few of his later movies when he is already considered a legendary actor, but nothing has tickled my fancy until seeing him as a young, very handsome Pacino in ""The Godfather,"" who can convey a million emotions just from his piercing thoughtful gaze. ""The Offer"" is correct; you cannot take your eyes off Pacino as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather,"" even as you witness his gradual moral deterioration. For this, I give this ""classic"" 8 stars in 2023.",love movie general somehow socalled masterpiece godfather appealed enough sit darklylit threehour running time however hear great thing offer making godfather decide invest ten minute time see series indeed wellmade show good story end watching episode watch godfather see movie would considered classic time interesting brooding shot cast powerhouse actor yet famous time since become huge celebrity right issue movie slow pace campy acting supporting actor like couple mafia sidekick father bride sicily awkward fade transition scene rather disjointed turn event forgiven discovered gem al pacino watched later movie already considered legendary actor nothing tickled fancy seeing young handsome pacino godfather convey million emotion piercing thoughtful gaze offer correct cannot take eye pacino michael corleone godfather even witness gradual moral deterioration give classic star

"""The Godfather"" - 3 Oscars, including for the Best film, the cast, which became legendary, the images imitated by followers. This film marked an entire era of gangster cinema fashion.

Francis Ford Coppola's film lasts almost 3 hours. Yes, it is long, in places it seems that it is drawn out, but this is due to the fact that the film was released more than 45 years ago. Then it was not fashionable and necessary to show constant action on the screen, the scenes were long. However, this, in my opinion, helped to show the life of the main characters more detailed, to feel their characters, to better understand their motivation.

There are two key figures in the film. And they are played by iconic actors. Marlon Brando masterfully tries on the mantle of the main mafia, who enjoys indisputable authority. This is felt in every frame, in every scene where there is a hero Don Vito Corleone. He solves issues, gives advice, is responsible for the whole family. Brando manages this image very well, you believe him, you associate him with Don Corleone for a long time.

Al Pacino plays Brando's son named Michael. And from the very first frames you realize that he chose a different fate. He's going the other way. A valiant soldier, a loyal son whose fate turns out to be different than he planned. And the character changes throughout the film. Coppola demonstrates this perfectly, and Pacino helps him by revealing himself in every scene. This is a wonderful work of an actor who got used to the role.

The rest of the cast is decent, but they all take their place in the picture, allowing Brando and Pacino to be the center of attention.

The painting perfectly conveys the spirit of the time. Gang wars, underground business, family troubles, death. All this is closely intertwined with the plot, perfectly placed in the frame, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere of an action movie.

I like the picture. There are no beautifully staged shootouts, fights, which is typical for today's Hollywood. This movie is a classic. The colors are faded, the deaths of people look much more realistic. It's as if you understand that this is not a movie, but the decisive truth, if you find yourself in that terrible world. After all, the mafia and its wars are not the beauty that you expect to see, even if it is gangster. This is a horror that you should not get into, because the result is likely to be death: yours and your loved ones. Is it necessary?

The soundtrack is also beautiful. The main musical theme is recognized always and everywhere and does not age even after almost 50 years. This is the test of time.

Coppola's film is ultimatum, beautiful and cruel at the same time, it shows the world of gangsters without embellishment, makes you think about the terrible times of gang wars. But he also makes it clear that the family is a very important place, so to speak. A family is a home, it is a motivator, it is a fortress in which there are necessarily difficult milestones.

Coppola's work is an excellent film adaptation of Puzo's book, which is a must-see for everyone in due time. Classics are immortal.

"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of the best films in history, and definitely the most iconic. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as its lead characters, it is much more than just a mafia film. It delves deep into society and family. It explores the corruption of government, the power the mafia had at the time, and doesn't hold back to portray the brutal life of the Corleone family. It tells a tragic story of how the well-mannered Michael Corleone turns into a cold-blooded murderer and eventually a kingpin. Throughout its long runtime, it gives you no time to rest, throwing twist after twist, and by the time credits start rolling, you will be rooted to your seat, your jaw wide open. Its storytelling is flawless, its characters are multi-layered and you care about them, especially Vito and Michael, who are essentially bad individuals. This is more than a movie, it is an epic, a journey, an observation of how great men descent into the world of crime. If you have not seen this yet, do so right now.

"The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...

Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:

Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather- steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...",opening shot godfather set tone film corleone family listen undertaker amerigo bonasera salvatore cirsitto pleading justice nearrape brutal beating suffered daughter attending wedding sister connie young bookmaker carlo rizzi michael highly decorated marine captain world war ii point guest kate diane keaton nonitalian girlfriend time coppola introduces u large cast character sonny james caan rough hotheaded impulsive kid never really grew fredo john cazale troubled shy weak young man cant seem anything right tom robert duvall righthand man legal adviser adopted son godfather steady reliable always thinking always controlled connie talia shire battered wife rebellious sister achieves promotes movie horrific scene johnny fontane al martine idol star whose tear set shocking moment movie big shot named jack woltz john marley find horrifying pool blood luca brasi lenny montana giant criminal thug one corleones trusted enforcer tessio abbe vigoda fearsome tall enforcer implies possibility violent revenge guaranteeing michael safety clemenza richard castellano faithful enforcer
"I've got a masters in Criminology, and have studied filmography, and I just don't get it. This isn't a great movie. The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me. Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie.

And as for the portrayal of organized crime - nothing personal, but if you find it attractive to honor men who not just break the law but flout the laws of civilization, then more power to you. Crime and criminals aren't glamorous - they're a sore on the backside of humanity that should be expunged.",ive got master criminology studied filmography dont get isnt great movie thing could make classic quality actor hired actor made quality movie one doesnt brando didnt impress least movie portrayal organized crime nothing personal find attractive honor men break law flout law civilization power crime criminal arent glamorous theyre sore backside humanity expunged

"As an actor who appreciates the art of storytelling and character development, ""The Godfather"" stands out to me as a masterclass in cinematic excellence. This film is not just a movie; it's an experience that immerses you into the world of the Corleone family, offering a deep dive into the complexities of loyalty, power, and family dynamics.

What struck me most profoundly is Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Brando's performance is a study in subtlety and power, capturing the essence of a man who is both feared and respected. His ability to convey so much emotion through mere expressions and a distinctive voice is something I, as an actor, find profoundly inspiring.

Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone is equally compelling. Watching his journey from a reluctant outsider to the ruthless mafia boss is a portrayal I find both chilling and captivating. Pacino's nuanced performance showcases his incredible range and depth as an actor.

The film's narrative is a rich tapestry of themes and motifs, weaving together stories of betrayal, moral ambiguity, and the pursuit of the American Dream in a way that feels both epic and intensely personal. Coppola's direction is impeccable, creating a slow-burning intensity that builds to a powerful climax. The cinematography, with its use of dark, moody lighting, perfectly complements the film's tone, creating a sense of foreboding that lingers long after the credits roll.

As someone who has a deep appreciation for the craft of acting and storytelling, ""The Godfather"" is more than just a movie; it's an essential piece of cinema that continues to influence and inspire. It's a film that demonstrates the power of cinema to transcend time and culture, remaining as relevant and impactful today as it was upon its release.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an artistic benchmark that sets a high standard for storytelling and character development. Its impact on the film industry and on actors like myself is immeasurable, making it an enduring classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.",actor appreciates art storytelling character development godfather stand masterclass cinematic excellence film movie experience immerses world corleone family offering deep dive complexity loyalty power family dynamic struck profoundly marlon brandos iconic portrayal vito corleone brandos performance study subtlety power capturing essence man feared respected ability convey much emotion mere expression distinctive voice something actor find profoundly inspiring al pacinos transformation michael corleone equally compelling watching journey reluctant outsider ruthless mafia bos portrayal find chilling captivating pacinos nuanced performance showcase incredible range depth actor film narrative rich tapestry theme motif weaving together story betrayal moral ambiguity pursuit american dream way feel epic intensely personal coppola direction impeccable creating slowburning intensity build powerful climax cinematography use dark moody lighting perfectly complement film tone creating sense foreboding lingers long credit roll someone deep appreciation craft acting storytelling godfather movie essential piece cinema continues influence inspire film demonstrates power cinema transcend time culture remaining relevant impactful today upon release conclusion godfather film artistic benchmark set high standard storytelling character development impact film industry actor like immeasurable making enduring classic continues resonate audience around world
"This film seems to polarize viewers - you either love it or hate it. That's how I felt about The Godfather initially. To be honest, I avoided watching it for a long time without really knowing why. I assumed people were overhyping it, and I couldn't grasp why Mafia-themed movies received such high praise.

However, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon a game called Mafia II. Intrigued, I gave it a shot, and to my delight, it was fantastic! The writing, soundtrack, and gripping story captivated me. When I shared my excitement with a friend, they pointed out that Mafia drew inspiration from The Godfather, suggesting I might enjoy the film if I liked the game.

Taking their advice, I finally decided to watch The Godfather today, and I'm thrilled that I did. While I understand why some might find it slow-paced, I was mesmerized by the characters' story arcs, particularly Michael Corleone's transformation from a noble figure to a ruthless leader. It was a remarkable journey to witness, making this film one of the greatest I've ever seen. While the entire cast delivered stellar performances, I must say Al Pacino's portrayal stole the spotlight, surpassing even Marlon Brando.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. Ignore the hype and simply immerse yourself in the experience. I'm eager to delve into Parts II and III soon.",film seems polarize viewer either love hate thats felt godfather initially honest avoided watching long time without really knowing assumed people overhyping couldnt grasp mafiathemed movie received high praise however perspective changed stumbled upon game called mafia ii intrigued gave shot delight fantastic writing soundtrack gripping story captivated shared excitement friend pointed mafia drew inspiration godfather suggesting might enjoy film liked game taking advice finally decided watch godfather today im thrilled understand might find slowpaced mesmerized character story arc particularly michael corleones transformation noble figure ruthless leader remarkable journey witness making film one greatest ive ever seen entire cast delivered stellar performance must say al pacinos portrayal stole spotlight surpassing even marlon brando wholeheartedly recommend film everyone ignore hype simply immerse experience im eager delve part ii iii soon

"There's so many perfect executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with the precision.

The movie is at its best when it goes all in its notions of tribalism and how they contrast with Pacino's Michael for whom so much of it is mere an easy excuse, his disconnect from his family beyond an ideal (outside of those scenes after his dad gets shot even those have a performative dutiful quality) give the movie most of its emotional stakes. Blood relations justifies murder and by the end that's really the only function it has.

Duvall probably gives the movie most all-around performance because he is the only for who the mantra ""it's just business"" really applies, Coppola strains a lot to make the movie large political observations, but they most work on his scenes as he has such a solid mix of people pleasing skills keeping everyone relaxed and constant annoyance that the work has to deal with so much gangland hits and horse beheadings. My favorite bit about the film climax is his final scene with Vigoda because the latter sells the desperation that plays strong against Duvall's annoyance that the matter must be dealt at all, it is no coincidence Coppola treats it as a privileged moment in the middle of fireworks effects that dominate Michael's large vendetta.

I must say I don't particular care for the movie final scenes, it mostly seems to die alongside Brando, not because he is the center or even the main attraction, but after that it seems happy with just performing Michael supposedly damnation and the scenes that related to that are the movie phoniest parts, it would take part III for any of Michael's damnation to achieve some human dimension beyond a rhetorical gambit that lets the audience more off the hook. Pacino's performance is at his best when it is clearly the Michael gets a kick of power and as a whole The Godfather is less about America or capital than it is about corruption and how seductive and awesome it truly is (one might of course argue all these three things are inseparable in Coppola's conception, but one of them take primary interest).

I'm less crazy about Coppola's Viscontian aspirations than most, but The Godfather do get a lot of its shifting between the grandiose operatic nature and the smaller bits of business that give it foundation like Michael desperation trying to get the gun or even better the baker tension at playing bodyguard a bit early or the split second Fredo understands Michael is really there to make his Vegas vacation over.

My favorite Brando bit in the movie is his scenes with Lattieri and I think it is mostly how Lattieri is the only actor who treats the movie as pure pulp so he gives Brando a different energy to bounce off. Their scene is about contrasting ideologies on the business, but it exists completely on the moment as a very specific thing and not discourse and that gets through some of Brando more mannered tics. By the same token, I love Sonny's execution or earlier his beatdown of Carlo because they seem like they could come from an Italian Godfather knockoff from two earlier later, I don't think the movie would be half as memorable if it was all like that, but I do think it would also be much worse if Coppola's just settle for the Hollywood wannabe arthouse film that it often gets praised as, the body of the gangster flick remains there and a lot of thrills are cheap.

That's also probably why the thing I take the most out of The Godfather are the parade of character actor faces just going through their beats, the fading stars like Conte or Hayden who are there for their associations, but all those less well known Italian American guys (Castellano, Vigoda, Lattieri, Rocco, even Cazale who really gets surprising little to do, but who every reaction seems perfect).",there many perfect executed scene godfather easy underrate nicely shaped movie sometimes overblown coppola manner transition generation capitalist period achieved precision movie best go notion tribalism contrast pacinos michael much mere easy excuse disconnect family beyond ideal outside scene dad get shot even performative dutiful quality give movie emotional stake blood relation justifies murder end thats really function duvall probably give movie allaround performance mantra business really applies coppola strain lot make movie large political observation work scene solid mix people pleasing skill keeping everyone relaxed constant annoyance work deal much gangland hit horse beheading favorite bit film climax final scene vigoda latter sell desperation play strong duvalls annoyance matter must dealt coincidence coppola treat privileged moment middle firework effect dominate michael large vendetta must say dont particular care movie final scene mostly seems die alongside brando center even main attraction seems happy performing michael supposedly damnation scene related movie phoniest part would take part iii michael damnation achieve human dimension beyond rhetorical gambit let audience hook pacinos performance best clearly michael get kick power whole godfather less america capital corruption seductive awesome truly one might course argue three thing inseparable coppola conception one take primary interest im less crazy coppola viscontian aspiration godfather get lot shifting grandiose operatic nature smaller bit business give foundation like michael desperation trying get gun even better baker tension playing bodyguard bit early split second fredo understands michael really make vega vacation favorite brando bit movie scene lattieri think mostly lattieri actor treat movie pure pulp give brando different energy bounce scene contrasting ideology business exists completely moment specific thing discourse get brando mannered tic token love sonny execution earlier beatdown carlo seem like could come italian godfather knockoff two earlier later dont think movie would half memorable like think would also much worse coppola settle hollywood wannabe arthouse film often get praised body gangster flick remains lot thrill cheap thats also probably thing take godfather parade character actor face going beat fading star like conte hayden association less well known italian american guy castellano vigoda lattieri rocco even cazale really get surprising little every reaction seems perfect

"Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless.

The first time I watched ""The Godfather"", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me.

I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing the thick, best-selling book to the controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters.

Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece.

Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable.",truth told godfather doesnt need review without undue emphasis francis ford coppola direction brandos pacinos performance literally flawless first time watched godfather child astonishing film id ever seen due introversion spending much leisure time front tv consequently watched many film childhood however hardly remember film godfather isnt one remember godfather watched yesterday godfather made experience feeling admiration almost film hour running time didnt bore godfather breathtaking film admire francis ford coppola mario puzo reducing thick bestselling book controllable screenplay anticipated expectation million already read book strength mario puzofrancis ford coppola script unbelievable interaction character seeing godfather still one biggest milestone film industry year release confirms film status outdated masterpiece whenever see becomes better impeccable

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by..

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

.Oh, I adore this movie and all the Godfather films! Every time I watch it (which is a lot), I notice something new. The mix of tragedy and a bit of comedy in the story is so relatable worldwide.

"In the spring of 1968, Paramount Pictures bought Mario Puzo's novel treatment ""The Godfather"" for $12,500 against $75,000 if it became a finished book. When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure ""The Rain People"", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary.

The movie opens in New York City in the late 1940s. The youngest son of a powerful Mafia boss returns from service in the war to find himself slowly being drawn into the family's brutal business.

Unfortunately Coppola and Paramount fell out with each other immediately. The director wanted Marlon Brando as the Mafia boss, but the movie company firmly opposed that choice. They meant that the actor was hopelessly passé and that he also was extremely difficult to work with. But, after being threatened with dismissal several times, Coppola finally got his way and was able to hire Brando.

The row flared up again when Coppola explained that he intended to travel to Sicily to shoot the scenes where Michael Corleone is in Italy. Paramount Pictures responded by contacting veteran director Elia Kazan, asking him to take over the film. The situation didn't calm down until Coppola showed the executives at Paramount some of his beautiful and exciting rushes from the Mediterranean island.

The movie opened in five theaters in the New York area before moving to over 300 theaters nationwide. And it was breaking records everywhere. Later the same year the film overtook the previous all-time box office champion, ""Gone With the Wind"". In 1998, the American Film Institute then named ""The Godfather"" one of the greatest American movies ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy. Francis Ford Coppola's triumph was complete.",spring paramount picture bought mario puzos novel treatment godfather became finished book filming began three year later relatively unknown francis ford coppola hired direct coppola made boxoffice failure rain people paramount counted malleable work fairly low salary movie open new york city late youngest son powerful mafia bos return service war find slowly drawn family brutal business unfortunately coppola paramount fell immediately director wanted marlon brando mafia bos movie company firmly opposed choice meant actor hopelessly passé also extremely difficult work threatened dismissal several time coppola finally got way able hire brando row flared coppola explained intended travel sicily shoot scene michael corleone italy paramount picture responded contacting veteran director elia kazan asking take film situation didnt calm coppola showed executive paramount beautiful exciting rush mediterranean island movie opened five theater new york area moving theater nationwide breaking record everywhere later year film overtook previous alltime box office champion gone wind american film institute named godfather one greatest american movie ever made testifying enduring artistic legacy francis ford coppola triumph complete

"This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays.",film long dull result first dull long period film warrant miserly acting competent must confess lost focus towards end due quite shocking lack entertainment attributed poor script lacklustre direction plot leaf lot desired people say godfather rare sequel improves upon isnt hard al pacino gained big reputation one left bemused unfortunate idea meant pacino mediocre actor best able infiltrate cinema screen far many occasion distinct lack passion charisma role display

"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.

Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.

Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.

The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy.",marlon brandos old flame glowed year flickered along trail bumpy mediocre picture shine higher brighter ever old irresistible magic revived paramounts godfather intuitive grasp mario puzos corleone living symbol poetic translation name lionhearted brando cool godfather sagacious head corleone family powerful five family organized crime new york relaxed loving indulgent patriarch large blood family mansion behind iron fence long beach li terrifically appealing man cheat death recovers bullet wound inflicted rival gang recuperates home enjoy garden grandchild dy old age come seclusion warn chief five family gang war must stop brando strong magnet draw fan godfather behindthescenes creativity equal value film towering proportion immensity project must staggering producer albert ruddy director francis ford coppola screenwriter mario puzo coppola make seem easy

"And i have to say the book is so captivating and gives so many additional layers to the characters presented in the movie. ""The Godfather"" is very well directed and acted film. Also, almost all the scenes are very truthful to the source material. No wonder the movie is ""Mario Puzo's The Godfather"". From a classical movie perspective there's a lot to appreciate. I think they tried to be as authentic as possible casting Italian actors, but some were pretty weak in their performance. Also some didn't fit the character very well - I really can't accept Robert Duval as Tom Hagen. The ending of the movie also felt so much more rushed. With the pace it was all going I thought the ending of the book was going to be unfolder in the second movie, but that wasn't the case. Suddenly everything just happened quickly and that was it. I don't know, but I'm getting regrets that I didn't see the movie first.

"I've seen some great movies, but the Godfather is more than a movie. The Godfather is more than an epic. The Godfather was years ahead of its time. In fact, if the movie were to be made today, it would STILL be years ahead of its time.

The movie was EXTREMELY long, and the beginning moved a little slow, but there was never a point where I thought to myself the movie was boring. There are a few scenes that take you by surprise, and a lot of plot twists.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino acted out their parts well. As ruthless as their characters were, as bad as the things they've done, you never cease to hope they get the last laugh.

This movie was so dark, it's as if death was at every corner, and it was. The Godfather was an action movie with a story... a GOOD story. How often do we see those? Try never.

I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment (I heard millions, and my expectations were already high).

"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) stands as a cinematic masterpiece, an exemplar of storytelling, character development, and film direction. Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling novel, this film isn't just a chronicle of the mafia underworld but a deep exploration of power, family, and the American dream.

At the heart of the film is the Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, masterfully played by Marlon Brando. Brando's portrayal is nothing short of iconic, embodying the complexities of a man who is at once a ruthless crime lord and a devoted family man. His raspy voice, deliberate gestures, and the way he cradles a cat in the opening sequence are indelibly etched in the minds of film aficionados.

However, it's not just Brando that shines. The film is replete with remarkable performances. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, a young man initially resistant to the family business but eventually its most ruthless advocate, is a marvel of character transformation. His transition from an innocent war hero to the cold-blooded Don showcases Pacino's incredible range and depth as an actor.

Cinematographically, ""The Godfather"" is a lesson in subtlety and nuance. Gordon Willis' dark and moody lighting, often referred to as ""Rembrandt lighting"", casts characters in shadows, perfectly capturing the murky moral universe they inhabit. The sepia tones used throughout offer a nostalgic hue, making it feel like a relic from a bygone era, and yet its themes remain timeless.

The plot itself is an intricate web of familial bonds, betrayals, and power struggles, but it never feels convoluted. Instead, the tight narrative and compelling pacing keep viewers riveted. Scenes such as the iconic horse's head in the bed or Michael's restaurant assassination are unforgettable not just for their shock value, but for their narrative significance.

Nino Rota's haunting score is another integral component, weaving together the film's emotional arcs. The melancholic trumpet solo that introduces the main theme is instantly recognizable, echoing the tragic undertones of the story.

Yet, beyond the crime and violence, ""The Godfather"" fundamentally revolves around family. It emphasizes loyalty, tradition, and the lengths one might go to protect their own. This focus on family is what differentiates ""The Godfather"" from other crime dramas and what has resonated deeply with audiences across generations.

Coppola's deft touch is evident throughout. He balances visceral sequences with quieter, introspective moments, allowing characters space to breathe and evolve. The wedding scene at the beginning, juxtaposed with Vito's meetings in his darkened office, is a perfect example of this balance - celebration and joy on one hand, and the murkiness of power deals on the other.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an experience, an immersion into a world that's both foreign and familiar. It's a tale of ambition, power, and family, masterfully woven together by Coppola and his team. Nearly half a century after its release, it remains as impactful and relevant as ever, a testament to its place in cinematic history.",francis ford coppola godfather stand cinematic masterpiece exemplar storytelling character development film direction adapted mario puzos bestselling novel film isnt chronicle mafia underworld deep exploration power family american dream heart film corleone family led patriarch vito corleone masterfully played marlon brando brandos portrayal nothing short iconic embodying complexity man ruthless crime lord devoted family man raspy voice deliberate gesture way cradle cat opening sequence indelibly etched mind film aficionado however brando shine film replete remarkable performance al pacinos portrayal michael corleone young man initially resistant family business eventually ruthless advocate marvel character transformation transition innocent war hero coldblooded showcase pacinos incredible range depth actor cinematographically godfather lesson subtlety nuance gordon willis dark moody lighting often referred rembrandt lighting cast character shadow perfectly capturing murky moral universe inhabit sepia tone used throughout offer nostalgic hue making feel like relic bygone era yet theme remain timeless plot intricate web familial bond betrayal power struggle never feel convoluted instead tight narrative compelling pacing keep viewer riveted scene iconic horse head bed michael restaurant assassination unforgettable shock value narrative significance nino rota haunting score another integral component weaving together film emotional arc melancholic trumpet solo introduces main theme instantly recognizable echoing tragic undertone story yet beyond crime violence godfather fundamentally revolves around family emphasizes loyalty tradition length one might go protect focus family differentiates godfather crime drama resonated deeply audience across generation coppola deft touch evident throughout balance visceral sequence quieter introspective moment allowing character space breathe evolve wedding scene beginning juxtaposed vitos meeting darkened office perfect example balance celebration joy one hand murkiness power deal conclusion godfather film experience immersion world thats foreign familiar tale ambition power family masterfully woven together coppola team nearly half century release remains impactful relevant ever testament place cinematic history

"amazing movie The Godfather is a 1972 American crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945–55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[6]— and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[7] The film ranks #1 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[8] Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,[9] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

The film was the box office leader for 1972 and for a time, was the highest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director.

"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.

But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.

The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).

The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.

Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.

Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.",know gay taleses book honor thy father professional mobster isnt sunshine rose often boredom stuffy room bad diet carryout food punctuated brief terrible burst violence exactly feel godfather brush aside flashy glamour traditional gangster picture give u whats left fierce tribal loyalty deadly little neighborhood quarrel brooklyn form vengeance match every affrontthe remarkable thing mario puzos novel way seemed told inside didnt give u world international intrigue private club constricted seventh grade everybody knew everybody else pretty shrewd hunch movie based script labored time puzo finally given form suspect director francis ford coppola get feel tend identify corleones family dig gang war beginning watching wait battle sitting kitchen table eating chow mein paper carton godfather even central character drama position go youngest brightest son michael understands nature father position revising oldfashioned way godfather role family enterprise described name stand outside next generation carry hopefully angle family legitimate enterprise read novel may surprised find michael center movie instead corleone fact simply economical way coppola get heart puzo story dealt transfer power within family marlon brando play godfather shrewd unbreakable old man actually character lead movie al pacino brilliantly developed performance michael lead brandos performance skillful throwaway even though earned academy award best actor voice wheezy whispery physical movement deliberately lack precision effect man accustomed power longer need remind others brando look part old corleone mostly acting partly makeup although seems stuffed little much cotton jowl making lower face immobile rest actor supply one example another inspired casting although godfather long minutely detailed movie three hour naturally isnt time go background identity character clemenza family lieutenant jack woltz movie czar luca brasi loyal professional killer mccluskey crooked cop rest coppola producer al ruddy skirt problem understated typecasting irish cop example simply slide sterling hayden let character go business richard castellano unshakable clemenza john marley make perfectly hateful hollywood mogul yes still wake find hell cancel day race success godfather novel largely due series unforgettable scene puzo good storyteller great shake writer movie give almost everything novel except gynecological repair job doesnt miss single killing open wedding corleones daughter attendant upstairs activity right number auto bomb double cross garrotings coppola found style visual look material godfather becomes something rarity really good movie squeezed bestseller decision shoot everything period decor middle late crucial theyd tried save money originally planned bringing everything uptodate movie simply wouldnt worked uncannily successful period piece filled sleek bulging limousine postwar fedora coppola cinematographer gordon willis also interesting thing color photography earlier scene reddishbrown tint slightly overexposed feeling like nothing much newspaper rotogravure supplement although movie three hour long absorbs u effectively never hurry something measured passage time corleone hand rein power would made shorter faster moving film unseemly even length character relationship cant quite understand unless youve read novel perhaps way character look

"It is sort of disheartening to read the plethora of negative reviews of this film on IMDb. There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of ""social media."" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between ""The Godfather"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not.

The acting (across the board), the script (almost entirely Coppola's) and directing (entirely Coppola's) in the ""The Godfather,"" though arguably equaled on occasion, have never been bested by any Hollywood or independent film. One qualification here: to the amazement of every film critic and everyone else alive in the 20th Century, the movie ""The Godfather"" was actually eclipsed by ""The Godfather, Part II,"" which really needs to be seen back-to-back with ""The Godfather"" in order to fully appreciate either film. The two films in combination are really just the 1st and 2nd halves of Mario Puzo's pulp fiction book, entitled ""The Godfather."" Coppola's screenplay elevated Puzo's 2nd-rate prose immeasurably, and together those two films constitute the single greatest piece of epic-scale movie-making in the history of American cinema.",sort disheartening read plethora negative review film imdb seems fundamental gap understand appreciate history evolution cinema whose power perception attention span impaired mindnumbing video game culture total immersion utter banality social medium even read one negative review seriously attempted draw comparison godfather lord ring trilogy loved movie way chrissakes apple orange one movie thoughtful introspective adult film far film though great entertainment acting across board script almost entirely coppola directing entirely coppola godfather though arguably equaled occasion never bested hollywood independent film one qualification amazement every film critic everyone else alive th century movie godfather actually eclipsed godfather part ii really need seen backtoback godfather order fully appreciate either film two film combination really st nd half mario puzos pulp fiction book entitled godfather coppola screenplay elevated puzos ndrate prose immeasurably together two film constitute single greatest piece epicscale moviemaking history american cinema
"The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film.

"When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.

Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it.

The storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didn't care about whatever happened to the characters. How stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemaker's bed, he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind?

"The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.",godfather vito corleone head corleone mafia family new york event daughter wedding michael vitos youngest son decorated wwii marine also present wedding michael seems uninterested part family business vito powerful man kind give respect ruthless powerful treacherous rival want sell drug need don influence vito refuse follows clash vitos fading old value new way may cause michael thing reluctant wage mob war mafia family could tear corleone family apart

"The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker. Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on. Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall. Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them. The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle.",godfather beautifully directed photographed designed edited scored performed american film masterpiece broadest sense colossal accomplishment francis ford coppola decade virtually owned popular artistic filmmaker indelible scene need word two ignite memory baptism horse head sonny fate restaurant murder list go brando pacino fantastic love praise work james caan robert duvall role might smaller couldnt imagine film without fury sonny unleashes brutal beatdown carlo palpable adore brilliant impartiality distance kept camera seems hover medium shot far enough keep child playing opened hydrant frame course pounding well onlooker know better get middle

From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy?

For example, in the first camera angle, when Michael is murdered in the restaurant, the camera zooms in and uses medium close-up photography techniques. This focuses people's attention on Michael's facial expression, showing his inner tension and indifference. When he goes to the bathroom, the shaking of the handheld camera adds to the tension.

"Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture.

"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

"The only movie I have ever marked as a 10. Masterpiece!

"It's impressive movie that I have ever seen, I love Story of Corleone family so much! Every people can learn something from this movie.

The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.

The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

This is the GREATEST MOVIE of the 20th century.",impressive movie ever seen love story corleone family much every people learn something movie cinematography godfather dark tasteful color used perfectly give true feel era set fair amount violence though rarely gratuitous godfather certainly doesnt need recommendation film universally considered one best time performance pacino brando alone stuff legend movie strong good script great casting excellent acting top directing hard fine movie done well year old aged well even viewer like mafia type movie watch entire film audience glued happen next film progress family loyalty greed relationship real life great mix artistic style make film memorable greatest movie th century
"I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.

This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.

Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.

Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might be better.

Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.

A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a ""1"" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down.",saw movie year ago loved favourite movie morning watched began pick apart movie first foremost overlong unnecessary dialogue scene weaken raw effect could produced musical sequence pacino restauant thing unlike movie doesnt fit part movie detailing pacinos stay italy poorly done also doesnt fit performance dull keaton lettieri conti yes believe brandos part badly written know hated saying character constantly change dialogue never consistent brando best dont think anyone could done better still great part outstanding performance caan pacino caans acting raw pacino right target besides main theme music weak unfitting said scene dont fit music score doesnt help one moment movie gritty masterpiece another cheesy cliched piece film going back traditional style film ruining film effect movie cut silly dialogue mention sansdialogue scene arent even poetic dialogueless scene effect might better also throw mud romance keaton pacino awful chemistry arisen disappointment missed recommend single viewing one thing film certainly doesnt deserve best ever shouldnt even top one hundred doesnt deserve rating give want average rating go
"I heard a lot about this movie and very curious about this one and after watching the movie i think it is the most powerful and fulfilling ride one wants.

It starts off very well but these are the turns which make that a wonderful experience. Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.

Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.

In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special.",heard lot movie curious one watching movie think powerful fulfilling ride one want start well turn make wonderful experience lot happening make interesting importantly engaging strongly feel movie like revenge way around found mind game politics hall mark acting brando take time high alogn al pacino well job music score movie need special mention still feel effect might strong without hammer strong music end like say watch always find something special
"The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.

The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore.

The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out.

Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren't formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene.

The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place.

Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don's sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members.

All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film.

What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity.

"This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.

Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.

This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey.",movie probably relevant may benchmark time made watching see added movie landscape effect subsequent film making film amazing mostly go long scene taking age without really adding atmosphere point impressive pause silence look stare useful dwelling time simply editing never happened film worth seeing history lesson film get understanding development genre anybody seen goodfellas casino mob flick unlikely find moral tale worth journey

"It's 2020, there was nothing else I felt like watching, so here I was watching Godfather for the 3rd time in my life. I thought I would just let it play in the background while i browsed my phone.

At the first scene, I watched & listened to the man sitting before Don Corleone, fully decided that I would just hear him out and then get back to browsing my phone.

But when Don Corleone appeared, all that changed. I was hypnotized. He commanded the screen. I could not look away. It was impossible. I had completely forgotten about my phone.

I sat there thinking to myself, how can this be? It's 2020 and this film is even better than I remembered it. I've watched this before already, I've watched countless of critically acclaimed films since then, why is this film having this kind of effect on me now?

For close to 3 hrs, I had forgotten where I was. All I knew was that I was part of their family. I was there with them in every meeting and planning. And I felt every worry, every betrayal, every attack, every death.

"I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief.

"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.

Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.

Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.

The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy.",marlon brandos old flame glowed year flickered along trail bumpy mediocre picture shine higher brighter ever old irresistible magic revived paramounts godfather intuitive grasp mario puzos corleone living symbol poetic translation name lionhearted brando cool godfather sagacious head corleone family powerful five family organized crime new york relaxed loving indulgent patriarch large blood family mansion behind iron fence long beach li terrifically appealing man cheat death recovers bullet wound inflicted rival gang recuperates home enjoy garden grandchild dy old age come seclusion warn chief five family gang war must stop brando strong magnet draw fan godfather behindthescenes creativity equal value film towering proportion immensity project must staggering producer albert ruddy director francis ford coppola screenwriter mario puzo coppola make seem easy

"The Godfather is a film that can be easily described not as a gangster flick, but more like an opera. We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way. Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business. Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding? Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III. Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all. I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time.",godfather film easily described gangster flick like opera see struggle one family trying run business world rival family anything muscle way al pacino doomed michael one day take family business try might avoid destiny cast outstanding script top notch film could spend entire first forty minute wedding watch equally great godfather part ii follow godfather iii say godfather iii weakest one say perfect ending opera one greatest gangster saga time

"I also saw Godthumb first. Both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable. I actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies. But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.

Yes, there are some powerful scenes. Yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story, as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies. Yes, it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start.

The story is even interesting so that I might be moved to read the book. However, I found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow.

I'm glad I finally saw this and found out it doesn't really glorify the mafia because I was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices. I'm glad I finally saw it so I could say I did.

But I won't be watching it again. I hear #2 is the best...it has to be.",also saw godthumb first eminently watchable enjoyable actually understand character feel movie godfatheri dont get many people say great movie perhaps cool one crowd bored yes powerful scene yes brutality startling back still work today fit story opposed gratuitous badly done violence many movie yes also interesting see amazing actor start story even interesting might moved read book however found pacing slow dialogue interpersonal relationship trite shallow im glad finally saw found doesnt really glorify mafia moved anyone empathetic choice im glad finally saw could say wont watching hear bestit

"Hailed as the best movie ever by most people, and I tend to agree. We probably won't see a movie this perfect in quite some time. Everything from the casting to the execution of the finished film is handled with such precision it is truly astounding.

I guess you are wonder why I wrote ""probably"" in the summary and well, let me tell you this: There is another movie that is if not better at least on the same level as this one. And the movies name? It ends with II.

That Francis Ford Coppola was capable to pull this of at such a young age is awe inspiring and even more so when he did it a second time around. I mean how many movies have a sequel/prequel that is if not as good even better than the first one? Don't worry, you can count I will be right here waiting for you to finish. What did you find?

"Dom: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse: FAMILY

The trilogy began. It's a story about family, revenge, and heritage in a mafia family in New York. The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I'm not entirely convinced on Al Pacino's character's transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino's character changed. Overall it's a great first third. 8/10.",dom im gonna make offer cant refuse family trilogy began story family revenge heritage mafia family new york first half bit slow many scene felt lingered bit long however loved marlon brando godfather way looked acted cool conveyed respected bos im entirely convinced al pacinos character transition still second half character became significantly better commanding course ending awesome showed ironic way al pacinos character changed overall great first third
"Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather. What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father's crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars.",complex story beautifully executed every character done job remarkably well well acted well directed well scripted basically anything good say movie relate godfather make film great develops complex character michael start war hero reluctant head father crime empire father attacked barely survives causing michael kill two men responsible run away sicily marries woman later killed michael go back america take father position corleone crime family ultimately sends assassin kill don syndicate completing descent evil gangster let u also forget ending well actually could go baptism scene last minute watch clip youtube watch entire movie time favorite film sequel also one greatest film time star

"I have seen The Godfather about 30 times and each and every time I see it, it still manages to impress me. It's not like any other ""mob"" movie that's out there. It's about loyalty, honor, and family which were the most important aspects of the early-day Mafia. It exemplifies every aspect of the commitment to keep a family together no matter what. The saga of the Corleone family, from ""Don"" Corleone and then to Michael Corleone, is absolutely brilliant. There isn't one defining moment; the movie as a whole is a tremendous masterpiece. I don't believe there will be another movie that will come close to capturing the depth and beauty of this film; at least not in this lifetime.",seen godfather time every time see still manages impress like mob movie thats loyalty honor family important aspect earlyday mafia exemplifies every aspect commitment keep family together matter saga corleone family corleone michael corleone absolutely brilliant isnt one defining moment movie whole tremendous masterpiece dont believe another movie come close capturing depth beauty film least lifetime
"In the second part of the godfather, the old godfather went to kill the hooligans who forced them to pay protection money on a religious holiday, and the process can be described as extremely calm and cold-blooded. When I got home, I hugged my little son and said, ""Michael, Daddy loves you very much.""

All admit that the second part is more or no less than the first. Because this book repeatedly compares the difference between these two fathers and sons. The old godfather was forced by life to join the gang, but he was very sober, one of his purposes was for the family, and the other was as mentioned in the first part, he continued to show favor to unrelated people, and used this as a hedge to keep himself from being completely limited to darkness.

Michael is different, ambitious, wants to climb up, and will do anything to do it, and in the end Kai also leaves him, and his subordinates are also dissatisfied, and his brother is against him and betrays him. And, of course, there is the adversary, who, because he ruthlessly swept away all obstacles in his way and killed the Jew's friend, the Jew designed him. In the end, as always, he killed his elder brother and purged all those who stood in his way, those who betrayed him, including Jews, subordinates, his brother, and apparently the Pope.

When people reach this point, they are betrayed and divorced. So in the third part, he ended up very tragically, lost his daughter, and died in loneliness.

His father was different, he was hunted down by the mafia in his hometown when he was a teenager and fled to the United States to live at the bottom. Later, he did a little illegal business and was forced to pay protection money by hooligans. Then he went to assassinate the scoundrel. Three shots were fired, the first shot knocked down the hooligan, the second shot prevented the hooligan from counterattacking, and then the second shot in the head to ensure that the hooligan died. Unusually calm, methodical, and a masterpiece, but unfortunately there is no way out. Later, he used gentlemanly language to threaten a landlord not to increase the rent of the widow tenant.",second part godfather old godfather went kill hooligan forced pay protection money religious holiday process described extremely calm coldblooded got home hugged little son said michael daddy love much admit second part less first book repeatedly compare difference two father son old godfather forced life join gang sober one purpose family mentioned first part continued show favor unrelated people used hedge keep completely limited darkness michael different ambitious want climb anything end kai also leaf subordinate also dissatisfied brother betrays course adversary ruthlessly swept away obstacle way killed jew friend jew designed end always killed elder brother purged stood way betrayed including jew subordinate brother apparently pope people reach point betrayed divorced third part ended tragically lost daughter died loneliness father different hunted mafia hometown teenager fled united state live bottom later little illegal business forced pay protection money hooligan went assassinate scoundrel three shot fired first shot knocked hooligan second shot prevented hooligan counterattacking second shot head ensure hooligan died unusually calm methodical masterpiece unfortunately way later used gentlemanly language threaten landlord increase rent widow tenant

"The gangster genre is a American as apple pie. We have had a love affair with mobsters. From James Cagney , Edward G. Robinson etc We Love the Mob. The Godfather is nothing different. It is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. The story is a rags to riches story of a crime family that stared out with nothing then rose to the most powerful crime family. What I love more then that, Is the character development especially with Micheal from a war hero to a cold blooded boss. It is the story of a family that faces challenges from both outside and inside the family.

If you haven't seen this epic. Then please do your self a favor and watch this masterpieces. You won't be sorry.

"Til today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",til today havent bothered review godfather everyone pretty much know one greatest film ever made imdbs top best picture oscar nearly review imdb whats one review well completing review nut guess time got around reviewing film reviewed long time ago goesthe film perfect dope wouldnt watch unfortunately imdb requires say meet line minimum review ill point need like gangster film enjoy film yes violent nasty spotsbut also brilliantly written produced start finish deserves accolade received advice instead watching godfather godfather part ii see combined version created televisionwith additional scene made rich experience
"There will be a before and after THE GODFATHER in the movie history, and I will also say in the real life Mafia, Cosa Nostra way of life, from the inside. The screenplay was inspired by a nover written by Mario Puzo, himself helped by a very accurate documentation on this sensitive subject. Before THE GODFATHER, there were two awesome films about the true mafia: Richard Wilson's PAY OR DIE and Richard Thorpe's THE BLACK HAND, starring...Gene Kelly. Back to THE GODFATHER, the funniest is that after this movie, the Mafia goons and leaders were hemselves inspired by the film.... It is purely awesome in any sense, from any angle where you can see it. Acting, directing, editing too; and this for both films GODFATHER ONE and TWO. Thousands of films will try to copy it, with more or less success; as there will also thousands of films trying to copy other films - also starring Al Pacino ( what a coincidence) : SCARFACE, HEAT, ....It is brutal, bloody, poignant, even for the most squeamish audience.

"I don't see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.

The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than ""Let's shoot him"" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.

The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.

I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.

"I hope nobody minds, but there was some discussion about missing English subtitles in the Louis Restaurant meeting scene with Michael and Sollozzo, and I had difficulty finding any apart from a general translation found here which does little to help beat and continuity.

"James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.

In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" - in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while ""The Godfather Part II"" was the second - in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her.",james caan passed away likewise excellent don hotheaded eldest son sonny whose frequent outburst provide great contrast measured reasonable approach father michael whose bloody murder provides another best scene film title character vito corleone marlon brando give fantastic performance afforded second final best actor oscar though accept fascinating character pride man honour value loyalty everything else strict moral code albeit extremely warped one family business encompasses murder gambling bootlegging widespread political judicial corruption yet refuse enter narcotic trade think messy lose family support among police politician generally prefer brando enunciates clearly opposed mumbling frightening soft spoken truly powerful people need shout time understands seldom loses temper using violence instrument reasonable offer refused incredibly strong compelling character brandos performance represents best work francis ford coppola said wanted best actor world play corleone meant either brando laurence olivier olivier one absolute favourite actor cant imagine first major film appearance al pacino excellent don youngest son michael corleone another wonderfully compelling character first scene introduced u army captain returned recently ended world war ii outsider member family attended college want part family business instead want normal life girlfriend kay adam illustrated two going christmas shopping going see bell st mary funny coincidence first sequel nominated best picture godfather part ii second cinema however everything change assassination attempt michael first involvement family business murder sollozzo mccluskey restaurant one best scene film spends several year sicily marries young woman named apollonia see killed car bomb meant part ongoing war five family experience hardens begin lose touch humanity return new york city find family longer feared given father grown weak corleones relocate la vega michael leadership attempt legitimise business mocked nevada based gangster moe greene thinly veiled version bugsy siegel could argued michael truly become man father death establishes new reestablishes corleones feared powerful crime family pacino deservedly nominated oscar best supporting actor rather best actor justifiably annoyed screen time brando robert duvall extremely good tom hagen don unofficially adopted german irishamerican son family consigliere often voice reason young diane keaton impressive supporting role initially naive kay undergoes steep learning curve brilliant final scene realises michael lying said brotherinlaw carlo killed film strong cast overall john cazale sterling hayden abe vigoda along brando one nonitalianamericans playing one film richard conte considered corleone richard castellano al lettieri john marley alex rocco coppola sister talia shire although shire little top last scene excellent extremely unpleasant scene connie break carlo beat

"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""

Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is an epic, masterpiece. I mean it IS a forever classic! 'The Godfather' has influenced various films of today, like 'The Departed' and 'Smoking Aces'. Don Vito Corleone represents the true qualities of becoming one of the most established, respected figures in society's minds.

Just after the release of the 1972 epic (which achieved 10 Academy Award Nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster films"" were being judged by the style and look of this one, in particular. The strong performances, the director's unique technique and an excellent script, I believe, all play a role in 'The Godfather's' success worldwide.

Italian-American director, Francis Ford Coppola introduces every major protagonist with a distinctive, complex individuality. Take Corleone for example, played by Marlon Brando. To me personally, he is seen as the most complicated gangster. He is not a killer, nor does he ever mix business with personal issues. He puts family first and doesn't like any weak people. Brando's performance as Don Corleone won him an Oscar and acknowledged him as one of America's greatest film actors.

All men can relate to and understand Corleone's responsibilities of power he permanently has in his family, and how he juggles life as a father figure as well as remaining the boss of his inherited family business.

The film opens on the wedding of Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). The wedding scene is a rather good indication, of how the Don's power expands over everyone in his world, from a regular next door neighbour to a killer. His son Michael (Pacino) has just arrived back from the war, in time to see his sister's wedding. Michael is portrayed as the younger, mature and quiet gentleman of the Corleone family. Given the chance as a husband, to take care of his wife, Kay (Keaton), he doesn't intend to become a part of his family's business and just wants to live a normal life. However, being the oldest in his family, gives Michael more responsibilities, which undoubtedly he can't escape from. Being a part of a big family, running a family business, enables Michael to have more family connections. The mise-en-scene and the cinematography are more dark and realistic. Even the sepia tinged colours are reminiscent of the year it is set in. In most Gangster films, the colour black is portrayed as being highly significant and is effectively manipulated in this case. For example; Corleone's main meeting/office room, where he makes all of his decisions: by having Corleone slightly hidden in pitch-black darkness, Coppola immediately creates that sense of enigma, sinister and chilling characteristics to Brando's Corleone.

Francis Ford Coppola's themes in 'The Godfather' include family responsibilities, father's inheritance, the need to earn respect and the influence of power.

'The Godfather' is ideally aimed at a wide audience, except children of course; frequent Mafia violence for males, to a light-hearted, romantic tale between couples, for the females. The film effectively plays on the psychological mind, human feelings and emotions, which audiences can still accept and relate to, today.

In comparison to other gangster genres, it was the first to introduce the gangster trilogy, with the film's continuous complex narrative that differentiates the importance of family. The representation of Italian ethnicity in 'The Godfather' was also new and innovative, under the conventions of a gangster film.

I enjoyed watching this film in particular as well as the others in the three-part gangster saga. The Corleone family story seems so uninterrupted, if watched all together, in one go. I just love how the dialogue, comes out of the characters' mouths so truthfully. I even feel that as a whole, 'The Godfather' proves to be the greatest trilogy in cinema history.

"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.",son mafia bos return war following attempt father life becomes embroiled shadowy world organised crime francis ford coppola classic gangster saga story criminal dynasty headed marlon brando one iconic role coppola direction deceptively simple us gimmick stylistic trick merely allows story unfold let superb cast thing brandos mumbling family loyalty obsessed since become part popular culture folklore along classic score accompanying performance top notch james caans hot headed santino robert duvals purely business orientated adviser film really story michael transition honest war hero shadowy underworld figure played al pacino finest role pivotal scene newborn godson baptised michael newborn godfather baptised blood time great birth modern gangster film possible exception goodfellas still surpassed
"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.

Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.

The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute.",godfather american crime film directed francis ford coppola produced albert ruddy based mario puzos bestselling novel name star marlon brando al pacino leader fictional new york crime family story spanning chronicle family patriarch vito corleone focusing transformation michael corleone pacino reluctant family outsider ruthless mafia bos paramount picture obtained right novel gained popularity price studio executive trouble finding director first candidate turned position coppola disagreed would play several character particular vito michael filming done location completed earlier scheduled musical score composed primarily nino rota additional piece carmine coppola film highestgrossing film time highestgrossing film ever made oscar best picture best actor brando best adapted screenplay puzo coppola seven oscar nomination included pacino james caan robert duvall best supporting actor coppola best director followed sequel godfather part ii part iii godfather widely regarded one greatest film world cinema one influential especially gangster genre selected preservation united state national film registry ranked secondgreatest film american cinema behind citizen kane american film institute

"The Godfather is a Crime/Drama movie that was released on March 24, 1971. The movie was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and written by Mario Puzo and Franics Ford Coppola. This movie won several awards which include: Academy Awards, USA 1971; Golden Globes, USA 1973; BAFTA Awards 1973; David di Donatello 1973; Directors Guild of America, USA 1973, and many others. Main actors in this movie are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.

The movie takes place within the world of organized crime. This movie shows an inside point of view of the mafia world. Mr. Vito Corleone (main character) is a powerful man who is viewed as a man who is sympathetic, successful, and a loving family man. Mr. Corleone takes good care of his friends and family and in no way (through the whole movie) would do anything that reasonable people would disapprove of. Mr. Corleone takes revenge, executes, or teaches lessons to the ones who betray him in any way. This movie is not a typical crime/drama movie as it doesn't show victimization to anyone not involved in organized crime. Typical crime/drama movies do show victims such as women enslaved into prostitution, families torn apart by a family member who is addicted to gambling, drugs, or alcohol, and sometimes just innocent bystanders.

The editing in this movie was very appropriate as the scenes transitioned smoothly throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end, the sequence of every scene was put nicely in place and made perfect sense for the viewer to understand where the story was going and why. Every single sound effect used was played well within each scene, making the scene effective in making it seem real to the viewer. When there are outdoor scenes the viewer can hear the wind, birds, traffic, and other outdoor noises. When the scenes take place indoors, the viewer can hear the footsteps, door shutting or opening, and other indoor noises, which are appropriate for the scene. When watching the movie, the viewer can see and feel the strong family ties, the loyalty within a social circle, and the betrayal. The movie makes it seem as if it is okay to get rid of those who do you wrong, it is okay to tell white lies, it is okay to do something that is wrong to protect your loved one.

The cinematography of this movie was smooth with all scenes because they did close-up scenes whenever necessary, and in every single scene the viewer can follow the story to the next scene without wondering what is going on or why. There are some bloody and violent scenes; however, that is typical of crime/drama movies. Culture plays a big part in this movie, as there are parts where people are speaking Italian and are doing traditional cultural things such as in the wedding scenes when people are dancing and singing at Connie's wedding. There are also the scenes when Mike is in Italy, and he has to talk formally to the girl's father for permission to date her, the traditional visits to the girl's home and family and the traditional Italian wedding.

The movie is trying to influence the viewer to believe that there are good people who have good morals and family values in the mafia world, and that it is okay to do something that is wrong or breaks the law in order to keep your family or friends safe or away from harm's way. I am not a big fan of mafia movies, and my opinion will not change about organized crime. I do know they have families, and they love them, but that does not make it okay to break the law in any way. The Godfather is a good movie to watch just for the fun of it, for good entertainment, or just because you like watching good movies to kill time, no pun intended.",godfather crimedrama movie released march movie directed francis ford coppola written mario puzo franics ford coppola movie several award include academy award usa golden globe usa bafta award david di donatello director guild america usa many others main actor movie marlon brando vito corleone al pacino michael corleone james caan sonny corleone robert duvall tom hagen movie take place within world organized crime movie show inside point view mafia world mr vito corleone main character powerful man viewed man sympathetic successful loving family man mr corleone take good care friend family way whole movie would anything reasonable people would disapprove mr corleone take revenge executes teach lesson one betray way movie typical crimedrama movie doesnt show victimization anyone involved organized crime typical crimedrama movie show victim woman enslaved prostitution family torn apart family member addicted gambling drug alcohol sometimes innocent bystander editing movie appropriate scene transitioned smoothly throughout entire movie beginning end sequence every scene put nicely place made perfect sense viewer understand story going every single sound effect used played well within scene making scene effective making seem real viewer outdoor scene viewer hear wind bird traffic outdoor noise scene take place indoors viewer hear footstep door shutting opening indoor noise appropriate scene watching movie viewer see feel strong family tie loyalty within social circle betrayal movie make seem okay get rid wrong okay tell white lie okay something wrong protect loved one cinematography movie smooth scene closeup scene whenever necessary every single scene viewer follow story next scene without wondering going bloody violent scene however typical crimedrama movie culture play big part movie part people speaking italian traditional cultural thing wedding scene people dancing singing connies wedding also scene mike italy talk formally girl father permission date traditional visit girl home family traditional italian wedding movie trying influence viewer believe good people good moral family value mafia world okay something wrong break law order keep family friend safe away harm way big fan mafia movie opinion change organized crime know family love make okay break law way godfather good movie watch fun good entertainment like watching good movie kill time pun intended
"Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching.

"The fabulous opening shot and scene immediately establish the spirit and essence of things. ""I've spent my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men"", says Vito Corleone. It's a great film, an immense narrative that stretches effortlessly over nearly three hours.

But nothing is truer than when Connie calls her brother Michael, Vito's son, a ""lousy cold-hearted b...rd."" That's what he is, a cold, heartless killer, a liar with no morals, a snake.

"You may have bought into the hype and rightly so, for being made in 1971 it's pretty solid. The story if halfassed and the acting is mediocre.

You could have guessed everything before it happened, very predictable. I just feel bad for the people saying it's the greatest movie e ver made. Maybe top 100 but I doubt it.

"Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries. THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.

The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York. He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. ""Michael,"" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three. Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business. He is something of an outsider to his family.

But Michael is devoted to his father. And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil ""the Turk"" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life. Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.

The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen. It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds. Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers! Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister. This tragic irony suffuses the film. The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.

Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender. The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the ""consigliere"" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo. Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.

Enter a world where murder is ""not personal. It's strictly business."" You will never forget it.

"The Godfather is an epic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences even today, almost 50 years after its release. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that combines a gripping story with stunning performances, beautiful cinematography, and an iconic score.

The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia dynasty in New York City. The patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is a beloved and respected figure in his community, but also a ruthless crime boss. When Vito is shot and nearly killed, his youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), is forced to take over the family business and navigate the treacherous world of organized crime.

The acting in The Godfather is superb, with Brando and Pacino giving career-defining performances. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, are equally impressive. The film's pacing is deliberate but never slow, building tension and suspense throughout.

What sets The Godfather apart from other gangster films is its attention to detail and its exploration of themes like family, loyalty, and power. The film presents a complex and nuanced portrayal of the Mafia, showing both the glamorous and dangerous aspects of organized crime.

Overall, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the acclaim it has received over the years. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves great movies, and a timeless classic that will continue to entertain and inspire for generations to come.",godfather epic masterpiece continues captivate audience even today almost year release film directed francis ford coppola cinematic masterpiece combine gripping story stunning performance beautiful cinematography iconic score movie tell story corleone family powerful mafia dynasty new york city patriarch family vito corleone marlon brando beloved respected figure community also ruthless crime bos vito shot nearly killed youngest son michael al pacino forced take family business navigate treacherous world organized crime acting godfather superb brando pacino giving careerdefining performance supporting cast including james caan robert duvall diane keaton equally impressive film pacing deliberate never slow building tension suspense throughout set godfather apart gangster film attention detail exploration theme like family loyalty power film present complex nuanced portrayal mafia showing glamorous dangerous aspect organized crime overall godfather cinematic masterpiece deserves acclaim received year mustwatch anyone love great movie timeless classic continue entertain inspire generation come
"The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families.

This movie is insanely well crafted and when you pair that with a phenomenal cast you get what many consider to be the greatest film ever made.

There are really two key stories taking place in this film. First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime.

If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly.

Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover.

"We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.

People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.

The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous. No other film can compare to its class.

Some people argue that the Godfather part 2 is better. Not a chance. It's good but it can't compare to this movie.",wont know twenty year whether film watch ninety classic personally think three justify title far schindlers list shawshank redemption la vita e bella three movie without anything missing movie seventy two fill classic criterion share similar title godfather people argue jaw star war movie script rubbish spectacle movie could compare quality godfather fact godfather blow closest rival water closest rival sequel godfather unlike movie ever saw begin great scene man come corleone marlon brando ask help hurting guy raped daughter brandos daughter wedding day man come godfather never gave corleone help brando refuse brilliant scene introducing u world corleones see ruthless godfather also see loyalty family scene hard match cinema history coppola go deliver even spellbinding scene beauty godfather every single scene fabulous film compare class people argue godfather part better chance good cant compare movie

"4/4 ESSENTIAL

The Godfather (1972) took many aspects essential to a film and pushed them past anything that had been done before. This movie takes the Corleone family, a mafia of sorts based out of NY, and creates for them an exclusive atmosphere. We get to see the Corleones in their criminal endeavors, interacting with the other crime families in NY, and working to make their family come out on top completely from their point of view. We never feel anything ""civilian"", nothing ever tugs at you that these people are evil. This is due in part to the phenomenal performances of (specifically) Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.

As far as script, any screenplay that can isolate your conscience and also entertain you is truly Grade A for a movie of this genre. Mario Puzo, of course, had experience with this story as it's based on his novel. That made him the obvious and excellent choice. These characters don't feel like actors at any point, they feel like family. Every member of the family has his own strengths and weakness that develop over the course of the movie, and they balance each other out perfectly. It's rare to find a movie with characters this real... nothing feels forced.

Coppola's keen attention to the smallest details makes this movie even more perfect. Look out for oranges appearing in the movie: they will always foreshadow a death in the Corleone family... He will always accompany the tone with lighting (a perfect example being the beginning sequence, which interchanges the mortician's visit to The Godfather and Connie's wedding with Carlos) and colors (darker shades of yellow and velvet are prevalent in most scenes with Don Corleone). Also, in The Godfather, there is a noticeable camera theme: fading drag-shots. Whenever these montages come up, they are accompanied by a very upbeat melody. Coppola borrows this tactic 11 years later when directing The Outsiders (1983).

The Godfather is a true classic, and my all-time favorite movie. It over-delivers and then some. Make a point to see this epic.",essential godfather took many aspect essential film pushed past anything done movie take corleone family mafia sort based ny creates exclusive atmosphere get see corleones criminal endeavor interacting crime family ny working make family come top completely point view never feel anything civilian nothing ever tug people evil due part phenomenal performance specifically al pacino marlon brando far script screenplay isolate conscience also entertain truly grade movie genre mario puzo course experience story based novel made obvious excellent choice character dont feel like actor point feel like family every member family strength weakness develop course movie balance perfectly rare find movie character real nothing feel forced coppola keen attention smallest detail make movie even perfect look orange appearing movie always foreshadow death corleone family always accompany tone lighting perfect example beginning sequence interchange mortician visit godfather connies wedding carlos color darker shade yellow velvet prevalent scene corleone also godfather noticeable camera theme fading dragshots whenever montage come accompanied upbeat melody coppola borrows tactic year later directing outsider godfather true classic alltime favorite movie overdelivers make point see epic

"""The Godfather"" left me somewhat dissatisfied, as its deliberate pacing and extended dialogue tended to drag, making it a rather laborious cinematic journey.

While the intricate plot held promise, the delivery lacked the dynamic elements I expected from a movie hailed as a classic. The characters, although richly developed, seemed to progress at a sluggish pace, leaving me wanting more depth and connection.

"I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.

However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.

Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!",honest first watched year old like much thought slow missed lot subtlety throughout movie however watched recently appreciative slowburn classic movie acting superb feel like everything even scene time period left movie intentional sequel make movie experience even better make ponder unknown gap part part maybe thats addressed novel dont know furthermore movie complete epic finale still blow mind get sick movie stephen king fizzle nowadays

"Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to ""Goodfella's"" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the ""Gladiator"" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies.

""The Godfather"" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create.",childish romantic view common criminal way equal goodfellas really capture truth underworld director must fantasizing imaginary sicilian aristocracy drinking much vino simply mining vein knew would commercially successful excellent performance brando pacino caan among others operatic excess film make mockery reality individual performance wasted unlike apocalypse godfather arrogant film little genuine substance undermines accurate understanding subject matter substitute yarn true story entertaining contributes deterioration culture like gladiator grab attention tell lie godfather cinematic equivalent baroque architecture excessive gaudy worth work create
"I just want to say that is the fantastic movie. If you wonder the old New York and mafias you're not going to be regret for watching this film. In the movie they're summarizing Italian's Life in 30's. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.",want say fantastic movie wonder old new york mafia youre going regret watching film movie theyre summarizing italian life shorn gangster trapping godfather sprawling soap operatic tone sprawl appropriate origin novel mario puzo also cowrote screenplay coppola large cast charactersmaybe large difficult keep track everyone even youve watched film couple time may find scene mobster seem spontaneously appear catch saying wait guy supposed soap opera angle positive negative depending taste tend like soapoperatic story course coppola put yummy gangster topping one make palatable guy like root though godfather concerned realistic depiction dysfunctional family try make lifeincluding marriage birth adultery spat family member tiff others community theory soap opera angle account much film appeal slight lack focus sprawl account much reason barely gave film
"Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by ""Goodfellas"", Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid. Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society. While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, ""The Godfather"" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law. It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.

Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian  American family of crime had become a best seller. Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story. The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.

The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out. Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola. Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board. It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone. Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra. Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito. Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part. James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael. Things could have been so different.

The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York. Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable. His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino). He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor  the Consilari. The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing. When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn. Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear. We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.

Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character. But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along. Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with business'.

Of course the entire cast is brilliant. James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny. He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later. Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael. In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films. Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey. Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.

The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite. The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit. It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters. Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis. The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel. When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began. Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling. It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life. He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.

""The Godfather"" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents. The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material.

"I have had a distinct pleasure to have watched this picture for the first time in a 35mm screen this year in a cinema in London that shows classic films. I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time.

"This is one of my personal favorites right here. I can't say anything wrong about this incredible story about the Italian mafia. The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell. I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life. At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film.

"This is one of the hardest movies for me to evaluate because parts of it are as good as movies get and in other parts it is almost painfully boring.

The best part of the movie are the two main characters (Vito and Michael). It's tough to imagine any other actors doing as well as Brando and Pacino, especially Pacino in by far his best role and performance. The story is quite good, but mostly serves as a platform to show how impressive these two characters are. The movie starts off great and has a very satisfying ending. It has also aged pretty well. A lot of older movies eventually get done better, but I don't think that's the case with this one. It does feel a bit old and if you aren't used to that, it might not work for you. To be clear, I'm not giving it points for how good it must have been to audiences when it came out, but rather judging it by today's standards. And it holds up in my opinion.

The worst part of the movie is that there is about 40 minutes starting around the midpoint of the movie which is very slow and boring. It's not horrendous or anything, but hardly any other of my 10 star rated movies (about 65 total movies and I've seen a lot of movies) have such an extended boring part to it where very little happens and it's quite uninteresting (to me anyway). This boring section is somewhat useful to the plot and it wouldn't necessarily have been easy to just cut out, but it could have been a lot better. The negative impact of this section is compounded by the fact that it is a very long slow boring section in an otherwise very long slow but interesting, engaging, and excellent movie.

I chose to give this a low end 10 (or 9.5 if such a rating existed here) because there is so much good in it and if you stick with the weaker parts, you do get rewarded in the end.",one hardest movie evaluate part good movie get part almost painfully boring best part movie two main character vito michael tough imagine actor well brando pacino especially pacino far best role performance story quite good mostly serf platform show impressive two character movie start great satisfying ending also aged pretty well lot older movie eventually get done better dont think thats case one feel bit old arent used might work clear im giving point good must audience came rather judging today standard hold opinion worst part movie minute starting around midpoint movie slow boring horrendous anything hardly star rated movie total movie ive seen lot movie extended boring part little happens quite uninteresting anyway boring section somewhat useful plot wouldnt necessarily easy cut could lot better negative impact section compounded fact long slow boring section otherwise long slow interesting engaging excellent movie chose give low end rating existed much good stick weaker part get rewarded end
"To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times.

An overrated story of an overrated person (America's infamous home grown terrorist), played by an overrated actor - Marlon Brando, which has almost nothing left from the juicy stud that made your lips wet in ""A streetcar called desire"".

Rather than being a fine adaption of an anyway colorful book, and a playground for an impressive group of talents, the movie has not much else to offer. No one of the actors is at his/her best.

"The 70s is my favourite decade of films, a new breed of cinema began and it started with The Godfather and ended with Apocalypse Now, both directed by the master, Coppolla!!! In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc.

Guys and gals, the 1970s was and always will be the decade when cinema had taken a massive change. Don't get me wrong, I love the 40s, 50s, 60s, 80s and 90s, but the decade in question just took a bigger step.

The Godfather is storytelling at its finest, it just can't get any better (actually it does in Godfather part2), this film is stunning, amazing, breathtaking and near-perfection.

The performances are stunning, every person in the picture is amazing, they really drew me into their world. Marlon Brando is amazing, no one could've made this role work. On paper, Brando's role is simple but the execution could only be done by Marlon.

The masterful story-telling crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla hit the right notes. Francis directs each scene with stunning authority. The production values are breathtaking, very authentic. Every person on the film deserves a hand. And let's not forget the unforgettable score by Nina Rota.

I won't tell you about the story because only the film can do it justice. Just watch it. Always worth watching every year, a film which will take multiple viewings to understand all characters.

The saga continues in The Godfather part 2.

"The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.

It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.

Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.",mafia epic others measured maybe even greatest film time dont think thats fair judgment cast either case francis coppola muchheralded masterwork jumbosized without good reason still delivers sheer ambition godfather sight behold packed full strong character complicated choice bitter twist fate grand decadesspanning arc close cinema ever come matching rich chewy abundance great novel even skim year third act treated layer upon layer comprehensivelydefined individual even ancillary role strikingly complex dynasty center corleones crucially diverse group distinct also alike fundamentally familiar despite offputting nature family business sonny hotheaded heir apparent fredo kowtowed black sheep vito rational wellcomposed patriarch michael intellectual firebrand lofty ideal retrospect path obvious heat moment shocked every twist knife moment deep contemplation contrast explosion spontaneous violence loud illustration literal dogeatdog nature particular line work coppola wrangle everything like illustrated puppetmaster married franchise logo precisely orchestrated timed peak efficiency yet somehow never grows formulaic loses touch essentially human organic pulse wasted movement missed opportunity achievement complete film magnitude accomplished year time first day filming opening day cinema absolutely baffling

"""The Godfather,"" a 1970s film detailing the struggles of a Mafia family in post-World War II New York City, not only changed the face of cinema forever, but also resurrected a genre that had been dead since the Howard Hughes mafia opus ""Scarface"" hit the silver screen in the 1930s.

Directed by then-novice Francis Ford Coppola, future mastermind behind ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Tucker,"" and ""Youth Without Youth,"" ""The Godfather"" not only demonstrates poise and expertise in writing and directing but also in acting. Coppola put his career on the line fighting with power- hungry studio executives to get the actors he felt fit the roles.

Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, youngest son of don Vito Corleone, expertly immerses himself in his character, down to the way he walks and talks, carries himself, and even shoots a gun in the famous ""gun behind the toilet"" assassination scene. Marlon Brando as the elder Corleone gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. With Robert Duvall as mild-mannered family consigliere Tom Hagen, and James Caan as the hotheaded Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, every part is well cast and executed to perfection.

Not only are the acting, writing, and directing top-notch, but so is the way the film is carried with great setting, music, and a feeling of authenticity. As Michael travels the picturesque hills of 1940s Sicily, ""Speak Softly Love,"" the famous tune by Nino Rota, transports audiences into the beautiful but deadly world of upper-class criminals. Everything in the film is well timed and well placed, offering the audience a portal into a life filled with twists and turns.

""The Godfather"" also reflects the fact that Coppola collaborated well with Mario Puzo, the author of the novel, and Coppola did a plethora of research to ensure the authenticity of his mobsters. The actors talk, eat, sleep, and kill like real-world criminals, embodying the swagger of high-rolling Italian mobsters. The dialogue flows from their lips as if Al Capone or Jon Gotti said it.

"In the timeless classic ""The Godfather,"" the portrayal of Michael's character development is simply breathtaking. Watching Al Pacino's transformation as he delves into the complex psyche of Michael Corleone is an absolute cinematic treat. From the very beginning, we witness a man torn between his desire to lead a respectable life and his family's ties to the underworld. As the narrative unfolds, we are drawn into the magnetic allure of his transformation, and it's almost mesmerizing to see how he evolves into a formidable figure, embracing the power and responsibility that comes with the title of ""Godfather.""

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is equally exceptional, showcasing the brilliance of two acting legends working in perfect harmony. Brando's commanding presence brings gravitas to the character of the family patriarch, and the emotional depth he infuses into Vito's persona is nothing short of extraordinary. The on-screen chemistry between Pacino and Brando elevates the film to unparalleled heights, making their interactions a sheer pleasure to watch.

""The Godfather"" is an epic masterpiece that effortlessly captures the essence of loyalty, power, and the complexities of family dynamics.

"Ah yes, The Godfather. An absolute classic in the film industry. With such legends as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and so much more.

This movie makes you embrace what it's like to be in the mafia. You feel like you're part of the Corleone family, and what actions they do to stay on top. It immerses the viewer into this sick, twisted world, and actively rooting for criminals to succeed.

On top of that, the movie is also very funny and quotable, most notably the ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" line.

This is a movie everyone should check out due to how engaging it is. There will never be a film quite like this in film history.",ah yes godfather absolute classic film industry legend marlon brando al pacino james caan much movie make embrace like mafia feel like youre part corleone family action stay top immerses viewer sick twisted world actively rooting criminal succeed top movie also funny quotable notably leave gun take cannoli line movie everyone check due engaging never film quite like film history

"This movie is probably the most overrated movies on IMDb, if not the most overrated. People on here are looking for too much out of movies and they aren't looking to judge them off of the right things. The movie was shot beautifully, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the movie is long, and dryly drags on and on. TO me the definition of a great movie is a movie that gets my different emotions running, whether it makes me laugh, cry, gets me excited etc. etc., this movie did nothing,I just sat there, I watched the movie, then I thought to myself, this movie is what people consider to be the best movie of all time.

"I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not 'get' this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask 'why?',your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody. As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow, the universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same.

"How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a ""masterpiece,"" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.

Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.

The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall

The film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.

It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business.",one begin describe film like godfather many call masterpiece disagree masterpiece implies perfection opinion film ever achieve perfection godfather come pretty damn close already know story godfather narrative thats complex yet simple story thats fluid interesting complicated story told ease like watching master artist work godfather superb storytelling finest story fluidity much character men corleone family distinct interesting due stellar performance course standout marlon brando vito aging patriarch crime family he simply magnificent whenever he screen thats discount great performance rest cast includes al pacino james caan robert duvall film technically brilliant well cinematography stunning bright color jumping screen black set mood well darker story moment sound subtle accomplishment hear chatter machine gun make heart skip beat hard pick absolute favorite film time could easily say lawrence arabia one flew cuckoo nest lord ring could also easily say godfather others done dont like making conclusive statement dont worry godfather personal strictly business
"My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience. A very good movie.

Not an out and out political thriller alone but covers other things as well.

It starts with the death of the legendary leader and the question of succession. But then the movie does not just deal with that . It delves into other things as well. Well!!! Baakki theatril kandaa mathi :)

"The Godfather has set the boundaries off all crime drama films that have ever been shown to people around the world. No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line ""I'll make him an offer he cant refuse"" will always be rembered.

Brando plays a character that is a family man, who wants to keep his family safe from the underwold. As well as to get out of the family business. He man who never wanted his sons to go join him, but yet he could do nothing about it. He is man of respect, a man who knows when the right time is, no matter what the situatuion is. He is the Godafther. When he was nealry killed by the drug baron called Sollozzo, he knew that his time as Don was up. He knew that there would be war, bloodshed,and that he could do nothung until he was ready again. His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business. Even to his displeasure, that he never wanted this to happen to his son at all, he knew it was the right thing to help bring back the weakened Corleone Crime Family, into where they belong. The king of the American Mafia Underworld, and the only way to do it is to destroy the five familes of New York.",godfather set boundary crime drama film ever shown people around world one ever go beyond film truly magnificent film show corleone crime family want revenge men tried destroy old beloved vito corleone played marlon brando seen greatest acting ever placed inside hollywood famous line ill make offer cant refuse always rembered brando play character family man want keep family safe underwold well get family business man never wanted son go join yet could nothing man respect man know right time matter situatuion godafther nealry killed drug baron called sollozzo knew time knew would war bloodshedand could nothung ready oldest son hot headed angary wonderful tactican like general could never run family second son fredo man enough job youngest son though person killed sollozzo calm thoughtfull ruthless man would person take family business even displeasure never wanted happen son knew right thing help bring back weakened corleone crime family belong king american mafia underworld way destroy five familes new york
"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.

This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.

If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.

"The three GODFATHER movies are an interesting, detailed look into the dark side of the American Dream. It is no accident that the first film begins with the words, ""I believe in America.""

We are taken along on Michael's journey as he goes from naive idealism to corruption, then struggles to free himself from crime, only to be pulled back into it. This is a classic American theme of initiation into evil. One cannot touch evil without being touched by evil.

The cast is first-rate, and the story has become so much a part of Americana now that some of the dialogue has even become recognizable catch-phrases. Even the theme music is instantly recognizable.

Watch the trilogy and see the essential American saga.",three godfather movie interesting detailed look dark side american dream accident first film begin word believe america taken along michael journey go naive idealism corruption struggle free crime pulled back classic american theme initiation evil one cannot touch evil without touched evil cast firstrate story become much part americana dialogue even become recognizable catchphrase even theme music instantly recognizable watch trilogy see essential american saga

"The Godfather (1972)

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Richard S. Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

Spoilers herein.

I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. ""The Godfather"" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.

Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of ""Last Tango in Paris"". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of ""family"" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.

This film, it's sequel and ""Apocalypse Now"" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like ""Scarface (1983)"" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"" and many others would have ever been made. ""The Godfather"" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5.",godfather marlon brando al pacino james caan robert duvall diane keaton talia shire richard castellano john cazale sterling hayden al lettieri abe vigoda gianni russo john marley directed francis ford coppola spoiler herein dont think viewing movie seen excellent direction acting writing godfather brilliant almost every way dont see anyone could call masterpiece michael corleone one three son mob bos father vito return home war sister wedding soon return corleone wounded mob hit michael want strike back michael eliminates corrupt cop competing mafioso public escape sicily michael gone corleone family begin fall apart marlon brando give powerful influential performance best career exception last tango paris al pacino also well continues later two installment trilogy james caan robert duvall diane keaton also give great performance supporting character coppola smart directing doesnt make film necessarily shootout pure murder though big amount violence instead show affect people something series family event build devastating ending nino rota eerie score highly add atmosphere film film sequel apocalypse true modern classic coppola made launched career al pacino diane keaton two hollywood finest actor two favorite everything film like scarface tried without film doubt upon time america goodfellas untouchable many others would ever made godfather definite great film viewed anyone call cinematic movie buff star

"After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S.

I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever.

"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWIl hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.

There's no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It's not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There's no way I can list them all.

While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in ""The Godfather"" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams.",come discussion popularity american cinema stated hardly american film famous godfathera film caught attention cinema admirer world watching film first sight viewer wouldnt lose much time learn gangster portrayed godfather dont care human life business interest come anything else hence perfectly normal man get brotherinlaw killed disloyal family violent scene kind aim terrify without gory cultural point view ubiquitous discourse american value italian gangster america make francis ford coppola film intellectually rich viewing experience wherein ample spotlight participating family gathering looking well family member choosing converse english instead italian apart character crooked face actor marlon brando garner viewer sympathy good performance come leading player namely robert duvall al pacino james caan however exquisite photography veteran american cinematographer gordon willis great italian composer nino rota two reason watching film ruthless family criminal left italian shore wreck havoc new land dream
"why are people trying to make this film out to be something it is not??!

this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. I mean come on, what a load of tripe.

I could get more enjoyment out of watching The Erotic Witch Project 2 (although I have to admit is pretty classy, the acting is superb, well done girls, you really do look and sound like you are cuming there!!)

Where is all the action the makes a mafia film class, like Goodfella's.

Marlon Brando's acting didn't deserve an oscar, it deserved a slap in the face. Sean Connery's performance as a spaniard in Highlander was more convincing.

Al Pacino's performance is total rubbish. The only good part he can do is a queer and that's in Dog Day afternoon.

As and for the director, Paul Verhoeven did a better job with Showgirls!!

What is wrong with a bit of rape in a film, this is the mafia we are watching on the screen, if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like, then at least show what they do behind closed door.

"For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made.",mafia member murder nothing business never kill pleasure case need cold revenge even summary justice punishment traitor instance besides normal family life cherished spouse child usually religious making pompous wedding christening funeral ceremony church priest direction reality atmosphere splendidly shown movie coppola directed superb way competent strong hand cast stupendous performance marlon brando play magnificent part role old godfather one american powerful mafia family mastering intonation facial expression effectively thus creating unforgettable character history cinema action unfolds along movie captivating way want stress particularly sequence christening new family godfather al pacino make oath name child also catholic godfather priest parallel cut show u time series murder rival mafia chief taking place time several place ordered contrast religious scene violence killing really impressive full meaning maybe best movie mafia ever made

"Definitely a classic. It never gets old! True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty.

"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the crime genre. Following the Corleone family's rise and struggles, the film explores loyalty, power, and the cost of ambition. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael anchor a stellar cast.

"In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a ""real life"" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie.

"Although the 19th Century saw the creation of motion pictures, it wasn't until the 20th Century that films really took off. During times of hardships, audience flocked to their local cinemas to catch the latest flick, which invigorated Hollywood's movie studios to create imaginative & lavish films. This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative & influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films.

Not once in this movie's entire runtime was I excited or curious to know what would be happening next. Because these characters cannot get you to care about their lives. They are not sympathetic enough that you'd feel sad for them, nor they are evil enough that you'd feel anger. They don't make you feel anything. These are emotionally suppressed people with very bland personalities - and their lives suck - but it could suck less if only they weren't overdramatic because the script required them to do so.

It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino.

"Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.

The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.

Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.

The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.

The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.

The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years.",prometheus gave fire humanity cherished imperative gift foolish civilization much needed francis ford coppola mario puzo also gave gift humanity gift object study film student epic dramatic visual tale film lover incentive appreciate cinema brightest purest form willing forget life little hour godfather never get old believe never withstood test time never truly feel like film year history time masterpiece begin resemble fine wine seemingly acquiring better taste age dialogue profoundly feel like discourse directly taken street new york beginning century cinematography acting feel exceptionally natural along cohesive coherent pacing component make flow film feel like river calmest day smooth beautiful noble every shot film faithfully serf greater purpose every shot feel like piece jigsaw puzzle never break apart ambition storytelling surpasses believe expectation provides sense wonder fascination nothing short admiration despite seen film easily time every time place eye ear glorious opening scene cant help feel like child going beach first time teenager going road trip feel rollercoaster seat peak waiting slowly descend sublime story relate term value characterization manifest course film brilliant way exploiting strength weakness every one character superbly even minor character moment spectacle motivation character come life outstanding take one ever truly feel expendable godfather colossus perhaps summit filmmaking something every individual appreciate little detail grand climax something remembered generation come something likely unmatched great many year

"The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere.

"This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.

Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.

The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning.

I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed.

"Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the ""Godfather"". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film.",youth would safely consider adult never get much witnessing adult story realize undoubtedly beautiful story havent read yet prior film mario puzos novel pulled gut watch film best understand story much goodstoried film godfather indeed made witness another beautiful story different origin never imagined many beautiful story would still lingering every nature environment country originates watching film start marlon brando playing role vito corleone known well godfather didnt quite understand really way crime world work get opportunity understand dealing business wit cunning deal practically teacher school situation different manner dealing nonetheless similar appreciated well film italian value family relationship trust vito corleone manage deal business mixing trust respect differently mend considers thing equally weight first time observed first time al pacino grasping character filled composure serenity maintained equanimity tide turned inevitable story admit one excellent film ive watch far character setting environment story genuine good couldnt deny considerably firstrate film
"A very good film. Good story and good acting and directing.

But it's not the best Gangster film ever made.

That award goes to the Director's cut of Once Upon a Time in America. It's a film that has much more depth to it than does The Godfather.

The Godfather is an entertaining evening, but it doesn't move you. You don't really care about any of the characters---they are all just psychopaths with no depth to them. We hardly even known Vito Corleone's wife, for example.

"This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.

There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.",godfather ii favorite trilogy since time young vito arrives elli island get name changed corlione establishing cosa nostra empire human drama told grand scale truly story driven movie kind fluff people talk day take picture make cinematography shot low lighting couple angry troubled character mostly self pity running around calling serious story driven plot line cinematography movie beautiful people overtly angry troubled way trouble anger real movie real story tell expensive original cheap imitation people trying hock around day story driven entertainment day great film maker trying make money make passion movie come existence way around movie one substance show watch movie treated best directing acting money buy true gem holly wood movie making

"Well.... I finally got to look at the IMDB voters n°1 movie, the almighty Godfather.

Though it's very far from being an average movie, and I admit I was rather immersed in the story, well... I've seen many better movies than this one, whatever angle I choose: story, screenplay, acting, direction, camera, moral points, invention, anything. I don't get its n°1 rating. I suspect many people praise it out of mere conformism.

Most of Kubrick's movies are better than this, a couple of Polanski's ones too, just to name a few. Other great classics like ""12 angry men"" or ""Network"" easily surpasses ""The Gofdfather"" both artistically and technically by a fair margin, not to mention more courageous, independant works like ""Brazil"" or ""Citizen Kane"".

Excellent movie, for sure, but best movie? Ouch. Its n°1 rating maybe comes from... consensus?

Just my 2 cents...",well finally got look imdb voter n movie almighty godfather though far average movie admit rather immersed story well ive seen many better movie one whatever angle choose story screenplay acting direction camera moral point invention anything dont get n rating suspect many people praise mere conformism kubrick movie better couple polanskis one name great classic like angry men network easily surpasses gofdfather artistically technically fair margin mention courageous independant work like brazil citizen kane excellent movie sure best movie ouch n rating maybe come consensus cent
"Maybe it's a generational thing, or I simply just don't get it, but The Godfather was bland and boring from start to finish. The story is hard to follow and lost me several times along the way. I felt emotionally disconnected from the movie and constantly found myself checking how long was left. Although the acting can be very good in some parts, the acting in other parts is downright terrible. It does not live up to the hype, for me.",maybe generational thing simply dont get godfather bland boring start finish story hard follow lost several time along way felt emotionally disconnected movie constantly found checking long left although acting good part acting part downright terrible live hype
"The unique. The only one . The greatest Godfather.

Any man has a lot of lessons to learn from this movie.

First of all, VALUE THE FAMILY. ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man""- says Vito. You should protect your family it's your responsibility and your duty. You must spend time with your family if you want to be a real man. This is one of the lessons Michael learned from his father and used it so much.

Secondly, PLAN EVERYTHING. ""Woman and children can afford to be careless, men can not."" You are the king of your life but to prove it you must be ready to any situation in your life and make sacrifices for your family. You should be thinking about and finding solutions to the problems not the women.

I would write more than 50 lessons that I've learned but there is an offer I can't refuse- I must sleep)

It will never be aged.",unique one greatest godfather man lot lesson learn movie first value family man doesnt spend time family never real man say vito protect family responsibility duty must spend time family want real man one lesson michael learned father used much secondly plan everything woman child afford careless men king life prove must ready situation life make sacrifice family thinking finding solution problem woman would write lesson ive learned offer cant refuse must sleep strongly recommend everyone especially men watch movie never aged
"Color Grading is spectacular.

Liked the way the story is told!

Good Narrative and not boring at all!

It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request.

"Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films. There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.

I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released. I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then. I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium. So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.

Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see. They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead. The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.

This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly. It has to be seen.",simply put movie oracle answer key blue print mafia film never better mob movie never goodfellas come pretty close godfather godfather ii mold goodfellas made first saw film year released id heard vcr werent quite common household item back cinema class high school view film teacher got u class day showed godfather big screen school auditorium fortunate see first time crowded theatre big screen afterwards entire class asked movie shown place one film due see offered play school evening u instead whole class turned second time plus another tagalong movie full fantastic performance top bottom try convey great film word almost silly seen
"the Godfather is one of the best films you will ever see. This is an entralling tail of an aging mobster who must choose from his sons a successor to his position. Having only recently seen the film for the first time, and then reading Mario Puzo book, you see how well most characters were transferred to the screen. Sonny, Michael, Freddy, Clemenza, Tom, Tessio, Johnny and Kay to name but a few were all well acted and true to the book (Though Johnny Fontaine's part was cut down severely). The only exceptions were the Don himself (Pure Marlon Brando, De Niro did a much better job of playing Vito Corleone in Godfather II) and Luca Brasi, who was hardly the scary underground hitman of the book.

"I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, ""Omerta"" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime.

"While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.

By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.",may claim showing scene reverse annoying trick make simple plot confusing add plethora twist wholeheartedly disagree good story teller know say say playing scene reverse experience confusion lenny undergoes throughout film showing scene chronological order btw use bw instead color make time distinction ingenious creates suspense build two time line converge somewhat rushed pace compared written format doesnt give enough time adequately analyze event movie two advantage firstly youre going talk leave theater adding experience immensely secondly dont time think happened happen youre experience better follows lenny
"To understand this films acclaim you have to understand censorship in America. Wikipedia has a nice section on the 'Production Code'. In short nothing remotely like this film was seen for decades. So when it was released it was a revelation for American movie audiences.

In todays light the film doesn't have the same impact it did back then. The script isn't written that well, the dialogue is labored and dull. Though Brando is amazing and deserved all the accolades he got from the film.

The plot is labored as well and drags in many parts. The enemies of the Corleone family aren't 3-d enough to really be too invested in the power struggles. In fact things don't really seem to be alive as in other mobster films like Goodfellas. The illusion of reality here isn't complete.

"It was the first event movie of the 70s, the one multitudes queued up to see, the one whose dialogue, characters and imagery instantly became ingrained in the collective consciousness. It made stars of Pacino and Caan, won Oscars for Picture, Screenplay and Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Shortly after its premiere in 1972 Variety reported, ""The Godfather is an historic smash of unprecedented proportions"". At the time the director, Francis Ford Coppola, was holed up in a hotel writing the screenplay for The Great Gatsby, a job he took to relieve his financial problems because he believed in his movie. He had only been given the film after a lengthy wish-list of veterans including Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann and Franklin Schaffner turned it down. He perked up when Frank Capra wrote to him, claiming it was, "" Out of this world. I cheered inwardly at scene after scene.""",first event movie one multitude queued see one whose dialogue character imagery instantly became ingrained collective consciousness made star pacino caan oscar picture screenplay brando triumphant comeback shortly premiere variety reported godfather historic smash unprecedented proportion time director francis ford coppola holed hotel writing screenplay great gatsby job took relieve financial problem believed movie given film lengthy wishlist veteran including otto preminger elia kazan fred zinnemann franklin schaffner turned perked frank capra wrote claiming world cheered inwardly scene scene
"Critically acclaimed for it's unflinching look at the Mafia world, The Godfather Part I took him three academy awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted screenplay. Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time?

"Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.

It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?

This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible. It did have *some* interesting symbolism, but not enough for me to give it a 3/5.

"The Godfather is a cinematic tour de force that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful mafia clan in 1940s New York City. Marlon Brando's portrayal of the patriarch, Vito Corleone, is iconic and stands as one of the greatest performances in film history. But the entire cast delivers, with Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall turning in powerful performances.

The attention to detail in The Godfather is nothing short of masterful, from the meticulously crafted costumes and sets to the expertly paced and choreographed scenes. The film is not just a gangster epic, but a meditation on family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. The Godfather's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, with countless films and TV shows still drawing inspiration from its style and themes.

But what truly sets The Godfather apart is its timeless appeal. Nearly 50 years after its release, the film remains just as captivating and relevant as ever. Its exploration of human nature and the pursuit of power still resonates with audiences today. The Godfather is not just a classic film, but a work of art that will continue to be studied and revered for generations to come.",godfather cinematic tour de force rightfully earned place one greatest film time directed francis ford coppola based novel mario puzo film tell story corleone family powerful mafia clan new york city marlon brandos portrayal patriarch vito corleone iconic stand one greatest performance film history entire cast delivers al pacino james caan robert duvall turning powerful performance attention detail godfather nothing short masterful meticulously crafted costume set expertly paced choreographed scene film gangster epic meditation family loyalty corrupting influence power godfather impact popular culture cannot overstated countless film tv show still drawing inspiration style theme truly set godfather apart timeless appeal nearly year release film remains captivating relevant ever exploration human nature pursuit power still resonates audience today godfather classic film work art continue studied revered generation come
What? How did a film like this get a rating of 9? This bored the life out of me! For a start nothing happens in the first hour except a wedding! Once things do start happening the story is misleading and the plot is hard to follow. By the end of the film I was completely lost. Al Pachino has acted in better films(Donnie Brasco).

"I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again.

I must admit that i am probably not the best person to review the godfather seeing as i don't really like gangster movies i didn't like Goodfellas either although i did like like the untouchables I believe people saying they love the godfather movies is simply because they have heard other people saying how good it is and think that in order to be considered a proper movie lover they have to like the godfathers.",understand big fuss godfather trilogy ok yes acting top quality brilliant performance marlon brando al pacino james caan robert duvall even talia shire good film drag whole story boring film seem go thing must admit probably best person review godfather seeing dont really like gangster movie didnt like goodfellas either although like like untouchable believe people saying love godfather movie simply heard people saying good think order considered proper movie lover like godfather

"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.

This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.

There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.

My Rating: 10 out of 10.",one favorite movie time part reason al pacino favorite actor well saw movie high school first time diving mafia crime movie ive seen handful time since despite running shy three hour doesnt feel like recent viewing thanks internet movie database top poster well jaime never seen plus watching bluray set father got movie based novel written mario puzo following corleone family changing guard vito corleone marlon brando run business son sonny james caan lawyeradopted son tom hagen robert duvall crew michael pacino home war hero see get mixed life never wanted becoming new there lot say new classic performance amazing francis ford coppola master filmmaking movie captivating jaime doesnt like long movie struggled breaking even older movie even set didnt bother feel authentic seeing ruthless people keeping honor another level one greatest movie time reason rating
"Just like Muhammad Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) the Icon of Indian Cinema is the Pinacle of Acting in the East, 'The Godfather' is the Pinacle of Moviemaking in the West.

1972 was the time, perhaps never to be revised again, when the great actors of the Black and White era transitioned onto color movies. Marlon Brando was one of them and this meant the past, present and future of Hollywood colliding together to create the masterpiece of masterpieces. Alfred Pacino, James Caan and the young director Francis Ford Coppola were the future, in association with the best of the past Marlon Brando. Thus, history was created and 'The Godfather' was made. I don't believe personally that there will be a time again in the future of American of British Cinema when there can be Talent such as this producing content such as this. The 'Good Times' of Film-making are surely behind us as Ideas such as these and Novels such as these have been written, sold and the ideas have been spent.

Like all things Filmmaking may also die oneday, but the story of Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather', which came in the form of a Book from 'Fact to Fiction and then onto Live Screen into a movie, shall live on for ever and ever.

"If this movie is not perfect, then it may be as close as a movie can come. The people who made this movie excelled in every facet. The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film. Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation.

The opening scene, the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone, is the longest wedding scene I've seen in any movie and not a moment is wasted. Virtually every character and plot twist that appears later in the movie is introduced here. When the baker mentions to the Don the Italina POW his daughter wants to marry, we never see the boy, yet he shows up at the hospital later in the movie, just before Michael's introduction to McCluskey.

Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is so strong, his presence and his character so dominate the picture, that for twenty years it never occurred to me that the title character was not Vito but Michael. It was not until I was an adult that I realized that the tragic conflicts in the picture were Michael's and not Vito's. Vito's time and world were fading and it was time for him to leave with it. Michael subordinates his personal dreams of achievement outside of the family to serve the family when it needs him. Once he's drawn into the family concerns, he is trapped. As he takes on the responsibilities of family leadership and grows as a man, his options outside the family diminish and he loses the freedom to be the man he had hoped to become.

One of the things movies give us are the images that stay with us. This movie is full of them: Sonny's beating of Carlo, the mass murder interposed with the baptism at the end, a disconsolate Fredo on the curb, Vito in the garden with his grandson, and of course, the horse's head.

"""The Godfather"" is a masterclass in storytelling that delves deep into the intricate dynamics of human nature. At its core, the film brilliantly captures the essence of personal connections and the emotional complexities tied to the concept of family. Through the Corleone saga, it unveils the profound significance of loyalty, bonds, and tradition within the clan, portraying the love and unity that define their existence.

However, beneath this familial façade lies a poignant portrayal of the high costs incurred in the relentless quest for power. The movie astutely demonstrates the contradictions within us, showcasing the dichotomy between the tender love for family and the brutal, self-serving nature that comes with the pursuit of dominance.

The film serves as a mirror reflecting our dualities-our innate desire for closeness and protection juxtaposed against our capacity for ruthless ambition and cruelty. It's a poignant reminder of the intricate balance between love, ambition, and the often harrowing consequences of choices made in the name of power.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" doesn't just narrate a mafia tale; it subtly reveals the intricate web of human emotions and desires, painting a vivid portrait of the human condition where the pursuit of power and the love for family collide, leaving an indelible mark on both the characters and the audience.",godfather masterclass storytelling delf deep intricate dynamic human nature core film brilliantly capture essence personal connection emotional complexity tied concept family corleone saga unveils profound significance loyalty bond tradition within clan portraying love unity define existence however beneath familial façade lie poignant portrayal high cost incurred relentless quest power movie astutely demonstrates contradiction within u showcasing dichotomy tender love family brutal selfserving nature come pursuit dominance film serf mirror reflecting dualitiesour innate desire closeness protection juxtaposed capacity ruthless ambition cruelty poignant reminder intricate balance love ambition often harrowing consequence choice made name power overall godfather doesnt narrate mafia tale subtly reveals intricate web human emotion desire painting vivid portrait human condition pursuit power love family collide leaving indelible mark character audience

"I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled?

"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film is a compelling and intricate portrayal of the Corleone crime family and their patriarch, Vito Corleone, played by the iconic Marlon Brando.

At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a story about power, family, and the consequences of a life immersed in organized crime. The film opens with a lavish wedding, setting the stage for a narrative that unfolds over a span of years. Vito Corleone, the head of the family, is a complex character whose presence commands the screen. Brando's performance is nothing short of legendary, and his portrayal of the Godfather earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.

The cinematography by Gordon Willis is a visual feast, with its dark and moody tones perfectly complementing the somber themes of the narrative. The film's iconic score, composed by Nino Rota, adds to the overall atmosphere, creating an indelible cinematic experience.

One of the film's strengths is its character development. The audience witnesses the transformation of Michael Corleone, portrayed by Al Pacino, from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless and strategic leader. Pacino's performance is a tour de force, capturing the internal conflict and moral descent of his character with nuance and intensity.

The supporting cast, including James Caan as the impulsive Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the loyal Tom Hagen, delivers exceptional performances that contribute to the film's depth and authenticity. The ensemble cast, coupled with the screenplay by Coppola and Puzo, creates a narrative tapestry that weaves together the personal and professional lives of the characters.

""The Godfather"" is notable for its meticulous attention to detail. From the costumes to the set design, every element contributes to the film's immersive quality. The use of symbolism, such as the recurring motif of oranges symbolizing impending death, adds layers of meaning to the narrative.

The film explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of a life steeped in crime. The intricate plot is driven by the characters' relationships and the power struggles within the family and the broader organized crime syndicate. The moral ambiguity of the characters adds complexity to the narrative, forcing the audience to grapple with their own ethical judgments.

Beyond its narrative and technical achievements, ""The Godfather"" has had a profound cultural impact. Phrases like ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" have become iconic, and the film's influence can be seen in countless works that followed. It is a film that transcends its genre, leaving an indelible mark on the history of cinema.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to resonate with audiences decades after its release. With its compelling characters, masterful storytelling, and unforgettable performances, the film stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling through the medium of film. Whether one is a fan of crime dramas or simply appreciates the art of filmmaking, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-watch classic that has earned its place in the pantheon of great cinema.",godfather directed francis ford coppola released cinematic masterpiece stood test time one greatest film history cinema adapted mario puzos novel name film compelling intricate portrayal corleone crime family patriarch vito corleone played iconic marlon brando core godfather story power family consequence life immersed organized crime film open lavish wedding setting stage narrative unfolds span year vito corleone head family complex character whose presence command screen brandos performance nothing short legendary portrayal godfather earned academy award best actor cinematography gordon willis visual feast dark moody tone perfectly complementing somber theme narrative film iconic score composed nino rota add overall atmosphere creating indelible cinematic experience one film strength character development audience witness transformation michael corleone portrayed al pacino reluctant outsider ruthless strategic leader pacinos performance tour de force capturing internal conflict moral descent character nuance intensity supporting cast including james caan impulsive sonny corleone robert duvall loyal tom hagen delivers exceptional performance contribute film depth authenticity ensemble cast coupled screenplay coppola puzo creates narrative tapestry weave together personal professional life character godfather notable meticulous attention detail costume set design every element contributes film immersive quality use symbolism recurring motif orange symbolizing impending death add layer meaning narrative film explores theme loyalty betrayal consequence life steeped crime intricate plot driven character relationship power struggle within family broader organized crime syndicate moral ambiguity character add complexity narrative forcing audience grapple ethical judgment beyond narrative technical achievement godfather profound cultural impact phrase like ill make offer cant refuse become iconic film influence seen countless work followed film transcends genre leaving indelible mark history cinema conclusion godfather cinematic triumph continues resonate audience decade release compelling character masterful storytelling unforgettable performance film stand testament enduring power storytelling medium film whether one fan crime drama simply appreciates art filmmaking godfather remains mustwatch classic earned place pantheon great cinema
"Vito Kliman: As an old generation godfather, Vito is the leader of the family and plays a vital role in the growth of everyone. In the opening study, he easily helps the Italian civilians around him solve problems. He teaches his godson Johnny to value his family and face problems like a man. He teaches Sonny to care more about his family and not to show his family's thoughts. He teaches Fred to participate more in family affairs. He has strong ability to solve problems and looks at the world with a long-term perspective. Although Vito is engaged in the gang industry, he still maintains his conscience and never participates in drugs. He clearly understands that if he participates in drug trafficking, all the forces behind him will draw a line with him. When Mike was in exile and Sonny was assassinated, he chose to meet with the heads of the five major families, giving up some of his interests in exchange for the other party's retaliation, and at the same time let Mike return to the country to take charge of the overall situation. This was the best solution at the time, retreating to advance and preserving the strength of the family. After that, the seriously injured old godfather Vito began to go behind the scenes and handed over the family business to Mike.",vito kliman old generation godfather vito leader family play vital role growth everyone opening study easily help italian civilian around solve problem teach godson johnny value family face problem like man teach sonny care family show family thought teach fred participate family affair strong ability solve problem look world longterm perspective although vito engaged gang industry still maintains conscience never participates drug clearly understands participates drug trafficking force behind draw line mike exile sonny assassinated chose meet head five major family giving interest exchange party retaliation time let mike return country take charge overall situation best solution time retreating advance preserving strength family seriously injured old godfather vito began go behind scene handed family business mike

But I didn't feel any of the fascination that many others did.

I suppose there are those films considered masterpieces that for some reason or other one just can't like. That is how this is for me. I could not appreciate the dialogue, very slow pace, I never got into the character studies, to much violence and I would always get an odd restless feeling.

"Let me start with what I didn't like about it. I know this is a personal preference, but I think the main storyline was too basic for me i.e. X does something to Y. Then Y gets X back. The X's friend gets Y back. And basically repeat that formula. The only thing that really changed was the methods of the attacks. And for this reason, I don't feel the need to watch part 2 / 3. But if you like this genre, then I can see why you would enjoy this movie.

Pros:

+ Great depiction of organised crime during that era. + The ability to build tension was top tier.

There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film.

A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations).

Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.

This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.

Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time.

First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).

The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.

The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""!

The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion!

The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!)

Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.

The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse.....",saw godfather always wondered seeing imdb top list consistent rating always fascinated really heavy duty expectation movie friend lent dvd finally saw movie widely said greatest movie film history quite long ago honesty wasnt impressed first viewing probably due ultrahigh expectation heard godfather part ii better therefore knowing character actual story part rented part ii time awestruck totally fell love part ii shall leave review godfather part ii comment section since loved part ii decided watch first installment time liked much better first viewing turned one movie get better viewing also picking reason hadnt liked time first though plus aplenty wonderful acting everyone lead role well supporting cast marlon brando never fails amaze majestic screen presence bravura performance al pacino james caan robert duvall richard castellano al lettieri virgil solozzo john cazale good although bigger part part ii made bigger impression story novel already one popular book ive ever come across story indeed powerful quite gripping cinematography need mention already talked sepia color coppola used throughout trilogy add wonderful touch movie make movie look beautiful lighting excellent effect one noteworthy scene talk solozzo hagen dim lighting give brilliant touch topic discussion score beautiful haunting music wont let go still casually whistle tune every thus far technical aspect concerned film flawless well almostthere revealing mistake listed goof section movie minus happy couple thing first biggest complaintthe length marlon brandos screen time scene total length min running time min wished could see greater great performance second thing blooming michael apollonias romance sicily appears time story shouldve really moved ahead pace caught scene sicily hit thunderbolt seeing exchange glance etc taking long could easily cut short hampered smooth flow story say godfather almost perfect film minus apart film really memorable scene go history classiest moment cinema godfather saga continues part ii even better first offer respectable movie buff refuse

"In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.

Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes"". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men.

Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.

Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Hagen should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.

In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.",new york city daughter connies wedding carlo vito corleone listens request role corleone crime family youngest son michael marine world war ii introduces girlfriend kay adam family reception johnny fontane popular singer vitos godson seek vitos help securing movie role vito dispatch consigliere tom hagen los angeles persuade studio head jack woltz give johnny part woltz refuse wake bed severed head prized stallion shortly christmas drug baron sollozzo backed tattaglia crime family asks vito investment narcotic business protection political connection wary involvement dangerous new trade risk alienating political insider vito decline suspicious vito sends enforcer luca brasi spy brasi garroted death first meeting bruno tattaglia sollozzo later sollozzo kidnaps hagen vito gunned street corleone firstborn sonny command sollozzo pressure hagen persuade sonny accept sollozzos deal release family receives fish wrapped brasis bulletproof vest indicating luca sleep fish vito survives hospital michael thwart another attempt father michael jaw broken nypd capt mccluskey sollozzos unofficial bodyguard sonny retaliates hit tattaglia michael plot murder sollozzo mccluskey feigning desire settle dispute michael meet bronx restaurant retrieving handgun planted clemenza corleone capo kill men despite clampdown authority five family erupt open warfare vito fear son safety michael take refuge sicily fredo sheltered moe greene la vega sonny attack carlo street abusing connie threatens kill happens sonny speed home ambushed highway toll booth violently murdered gangster wielding submachine gun sicily michael meet marries apollonia car bomb intended take life devastated sonny death realizing tattaglias controlled nowdominant barzini vito attempt end feud assures five family withdraw opposition heroin business forgo avenging sonny murder safety guaranteed michael return home enter family business marry kay promising business legitimate within five year kay give birth two child early father nearing end life fredo weak michael take family rein insists hagen relocate la vega relinquish role vito hagen wartime consigliere vito agrees hagen part happen coming battle rival family michael travel la vega buy greene stake family casino dismayed see fredo loyal greene family vito suffers fatal heart attack funeral tessio corleone capo asks michael meet barzini signaling betrayal vito forewarned meeting set day baptism connies baby michael stand altar child godfather corleone hitman murder new york city don greene tessios treachery lead execution michael extract carlos confession complicity setting sonny murder barzini clemenza garrote carlo death connie accuses michael murder telling kay michael ordered killing kay relieved michael finally denies capo arrive address husband corleone watch pay reverence michael newly installed close door

"Considered by many people (including the top 250 rank here in IMDb) as the best film in history, ""The Godfather"" is that kind of movie you just can't miss. Where else can we find great actors like Marlo Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan? In part II Robert De Niro enhances this trilogy even more.

The story is about Vito Corleone (Brando) who is the leader of a New York Mafia family, The Corleone, that make money with gambling.His son Michael (Pacino) doesn't feel like taking part in this life although he's often invited to by his father.

Vito Corleone has even more problems when he doesn't want to take part in drug business and when he sees that there's no one to substitute him in the family leadership.

"""The Godfather"" is the ultimate mafia movie. It portrays the mafia from within, that is the Corleone family.

The film highlights above all the importance of three (related) concepts: family, food and succession.

The importance of family is typical for societies with a weak state (and certainly no welfare state). This concept is illustrated right at the beginning of the movie. A father whose daughters haven been dishonored by some guys aks Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to take revenge on those boys. Don Corleone is not surprised at all about this request. He is however offended by the fact that the father had first reported the issue to the police (= the state).

In this family driven society business is done in an informal way, not by formal contracts. The ultimate event to make these informal agreements is dinner. The film has numerous memorable dinner scenes. These dinners can be in a restaurant or at home, but when business is done they are always without women. Part of being a mafioso is therefore the ability to prepare a good meal. One would not expect something so emancipated in such a patriarchal environment!

Also the last concept of succession is tightly related to family. Succession is not a matter of ability alone but a matter of both ability and the bond of blood. After the death of Sonny (James Caan) Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) becomes the crown prince. At first he is a an unwilling crown prince, prefering a career in legal businesses. During the scond half of the film however we see him coming to terms with his destiny, even embrace it as a vocation.

In the brilliant last scene Micheal Corleone's wife (Diane Keaton) watches her man while his subordinates kiss his hands. Much to her disgust Michael Corleone is now the Don. After this the door of the room of the men is closed. I don't know if during the making of the Godfather there were already plans for a sequel, but in any case this ending scene is the perfect cliffhanger.

""The Godfather"" was the comeback film of Marlon Brando and the breakthrough of Al Pacino. It is a good film but in my opinion not as good as his reputation.",godfather ultimate mafia movie portrays mafia within corleone family film highlight importance three related concept family food succession importance family typical society weak state certainly welfare state concept illustrated right beginning movie father whose daughter dishonored guy ak corleone marlon brando take revenge boy corleone surprised request however offended fact father first reported issue police state family driven society business done informal way formal contract ultimate event make informal agreement dinner film numerous memorable dinner scene dinner restaurant home business done always without woman part mafioso therefore ability prepare good meal one would expect something emancipated patriarchal environment also last concept succession tightly related family succession matter ability alone matter ability bond blood death sonny james caan michael corleone al pacino becomes crown prince first unwilling crown prince prefering career legal business scond half film however see coming term destiny even embrace vocation brilliant last scene micheal corleones wife diane keaton watch man subordinate kiss hand much disgust michael corleone door room men closed dont know making godfather already plan sequel case ending scene perfect cliffhanger godfather comeback film marlon brando breakthrough al pacino good film opinion good reputation
"Whenever you hear about this film people always put it on a pedestal about how amazing it is and how its the 'best film ever made' etc and its rated on this site at 9.2. I Honestly cannot rack my brain to come up with an answer to why it's rated so highly in peoples opinion!

The problem with this film is that so many more films have been made of this genre with similar story lines since The Godfather was made...an unfortunately for The Godfather....the others have done it much better (Casino, Goodfella's etc).

It's ridiculously long, I do enjoy a lot of long films, however if it is to be so long then it has to be exciting to keep it going. The Godfather is so so slow paced! And people always go on about Marlon Brando's 'amazing acting' in this...all he done was stick his jaw out a little and mumble all his words! Al Pacino's character is much more interesting. One of the most overrated, boring films I've ever seen...apart from Part II which is even worse!

"A note about the poor reviews- Reading through the lower one and two star ratings I was shocked to see how many people are incapable of understanding the true masterpiece of a film that this is. The fact that people think this is unrealistic shows that they know nothing of this time period of mafia. They think of Al Capone and the violence that is related to him, and assume this is the only type of person in the mafia. You need to understand that the mafia wasn't just guns, money, and murder. It was a business, yes illegal, but a business. It had class. People who say this movie didn't have plot shock me. It tells me they were either not paying attention or just too simple minded to understand it.

On a note about the movie- It was an excellent portrayal of the mafia during this time. Everything about this movie was perfect. The acting was so believable it's hard to see these actors in other films. The culture of Italian American and Italian is touching and realistic. The show of family, emotions, and the complexities of the underworld are superior to any other film, specifically other mafia movies. I enjoy Goodfellas and Scarface but they just don't compare. We must remember that they are set in different time periods so they are all realistic but very different, for this reason you cannot say the Godfather isn't realistic because it isn't similar to Goodfellas. I prefer the class and composure of the older setting in Godfather. Truly an amazing film. Undoubtedly the best.",note poor review reading lower one two star rating shocked see many people incapable understanding true masterpiece film fact people think unrealistic show know nothing time period mafia think al capone violence related assume type person mafia need understand mafia wasnt gun money murder business yes illegal business class people say movie didnt plot shock tell either paying attention simple minded understand note movie excellent portrayal mafia time everything movie perfect acting believable hard see actor film culture italian american italian touching realistic show family emotion complexity underworld superior film specifically mafia movie enjoy goodfellas scarface dont compare must remember set different time period realistic different reason cannot say godfather isnt realistic isnt similar goodfellas prefer class composure older setting godfather truly amazing film undoubtedly best

"This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.

The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.

The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.

The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.

What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.

"The Godfather is not just a film; it's an immersive experience into the heart of family, power, and loyalty. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this 1972 masterpiece has stood the test of time, remaining as relevant today as when it first hit cinemas. What's striking is its balance of grandeur and intimacy-there's an almost operatic scale to its portrayal of the Mafia, yet at its core, it's about family dynamics and the personal costs of power. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, his presence a masterclass in subtlety and gravitas. The film's dialogue is steeped in a quiet menace, with memorable lines that have become part of the cultural lexicon. Its pacing and cinematography are flawless, drawing the viewer into its world with an atmosphere of inevitable tragedy.

What I'm trying to say people is DO NOT expect it to be the best movie ever made, because it is far from it. It takes SO MUCH out from the original book that you'll wonder if the book and the movie are written by the same person.

That's not to say this movie is bad, but rather it misses out on so much from one of the greatest books I've ever read. Where is the Adventures of Johnny and Nino!? Where is the vaginal surgery?? Why isn't Doctor Jules in this movie?! Why the hell did they make Tessio insignificant? Why didn't they let you know more about Paulie Gatto?? The only reason you'll want to see this is if you are a mob movie fanatic or so you will understand the 2nd movie more (which by the way is in every respect better). It is a good movie, but there are many flaws such as the acting quality, the way that you must practically smash your windows because your turning the volume up so high to understand what they're saying among other things. Good movie, but not #1.",first went site excited top movie nearly exploded saw prestigious position taken coppola classic godfather like ah expected seems deserving actually rented hope would best movie ever quite shocked im trying say people expect best movie ever made far take much original book youll wonder book movie written person thats say movie bad rather miss much one greatest book ive ever read adventure johnny nino vaginal surgery isnt doctor jules movie hell make tessio insignificant didnt let know paulie gatto reason youll want see mob movie fanatic understand nd movie way every respect better good movie many flaw acting quality way must practically smash window turning volume high understand theyre saying among thing good movie

"It absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel.",absorbs u effectively never hurry something measured passage time corleone hand rein power would made shorter faster moving film unseemly even length character relationship cant quite understand unless youve read novel
